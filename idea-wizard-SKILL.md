# The Idea Wizard

Come up with your very best ideas for improving this project.

First generate a list of 30 ideas (brief one-liner for each).

Then go through each one systematically and critically evaluate it, rejecting the ones that are not excellent choices for good reasons and keeping the ones that pass your scrutiny.

Then, for each idea that passed your test, explain in detail exactly what the idea is (in the form of a concrete, specific, actionable plan with detailed code snippets where relevant), why it would be a good improvement, what are the possible downsides, and how confident you are that it actually improves the project (0-100%). Make sure to actually implement the top ideas now.

Use ultrathink.

## When to Use

- When starting a new feature or project
- When reviewing a codebase for improvements
- When stuck and need creative solutions
- At the start of a coding session for fresh perspective

## Tips

- Run this at the start of a session for fresh perspective
- Combine with ultrathink for deeper analysis
- Focus on the top 3-5 ideas if time-constrained
- Let the agent implement ideas immediately after evaluation
