{"id":"jeffreysprompts.com-1m9a","title":"Enhance copy button feedback with satisfying animation","description":"# Task: Enhance Copy Button Feedback\n\n## Context\nThe copy button currently changes from Copy icon to Check icon when clicked. While functional, it lacks the \"satisfying\" micro-interaction that Stripe/Linear provide.\n\n## Current Behavior\n1. User clicks Copy button\n2. Icon changes from Copy → Check (instant)\n3. Toast appears\n4. After 2s, icon changes back\n\n## Proposed Enhancements\n\n### 1. Icon Transition Animation\n```typescript\nimport { motion, AnimatePresence } from 'framer-motion';\n\n// In PromptCard.tsx copy button\n<Button onClick={handleCopy} ...>\n  <AnimatePresence mode=\"wait\">\n    {copied ? (\n      <motion.div\n        key=\"check\"\n        initial={{ scale: 0, rotate: -180 }}\n        animate={{ scale: 1, rotate: 0 }}\n        exit={{ scale: 0, rotate: 180 }}\n        transition={{ type: \"spring\", stiffness: 500, damping: 25 }}\n      >\n        <Check className=\"w-4 h-4 text-emerald-500\" />\n      </motion.div>\n    ) : (\n      <motion.div\n        key=\"copy\"\n        initial={{ scale: 0 }}\n        animate={{ scale: 1 }}\n        exit={{ scale: 0 }}\n        transition={{ duration: 0.15 }}\n      >\n        <Copy className=\"w-4 h-4\" />\n      </motion.div>\n    )}\n  </AnimatePresence>\n</Button>\n```\n\n### 2. Button Background Flash\n```typescript\n// Add success background flash\nconst [showFlash, setShowFlash] = useState(false);\n\nconst handleCopy = async () => {\n  await navigator.clipboard.writeText(content);\n  setCopied(true);\n  setShowFlash(true);\n  setTimeout(() => setShowFlash(false), 300);\n  // ... rest of handler\n};\n\n<Button\n  className={cn(\n    \"...\",\n    showFlash && \"bg-emerald-100 dark:bg-emerald-900/30\"\n  )}\n>\n```\n\n### 3. Ripple Effect (Optional)\n```typescript\n// CSS ripple on click\n.copy-button {\n  position: relative;\n  overflow: hidden;\n}\n\n.copy-button::after {\n  content: '';\n  position: absolute;\n  inset: 0;\n  background: radial-gradient(circle at center, \n    oklch(0.9 0.1 145) 0%, \n    transparent 70%\n  );\n  opacity: 0;\n  transform: scale(0);\n  transition: transform 0.3s, opacity 0.3s;\n}\n\n.copy-button.copied::after {\n  opacity: 1;\n  transform: scale(2);\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Haptic Feedback (Mobile)\n```typescript\nconst handleCopy = async () => {\n  // Haptic feedback if available\n  if ('vibrate' in navigator) {\n    navigator.vibrate(50); // 50ms vibration\n  }\n  // ... rest of copy logic\n};\n```\n\n## Design Rationale\n- Spring animation on Check: Feels \"bouncy\" and satisfying\n- Rotate effect: Draws eye, makes change obvious\n- Background flash: Confirms action without being distracting\n- Haptic feedback: Mobile users feel the action\n\n## Reduced Motion Support\n```typescript\nconst prefersReducedMotion = useReducedMotion();\n\n// Skip animation, just swap icons\n{copied ? (\n  <Check className=\"w-4 h-4 text-emerald-500\" />\n) : (\n  <Copy className=\"w-4 h-4\" />\n)}\n```\n\n## Testing\n1. Click copy - see icon spin/bounce into check\n2. Background flashes briefly green\n3. After 2s, icon spins back to copy\n4. Mobile: feel haptic feedback\n5. Reduced motion: instant icon swap\n6. Multiple rapid clicks: animation doesn't break\n\n## Files Modified\n- apps/web/src/components/PromptCard.tsx\n- apps/web/src/components/PromptDetailModal.tsx (same pattern)\n- apps/web/src/components/mobile/SwipeablePromptCard.tsx\n\n## Dependencies\n- Framer Motion (already available)\n- Lower priority than functional improvements","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-12T06:09:39.419096088Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-12T15:16:43.728049147Z","closed_at":"2026-01-12T15:16:43.728049147Z","close_reason":"Implemented satisfying micro-interactions with spring animations, background flash, and haptic feedback","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"jeffreysprompts.com-1m9a","depends_on_id":"jeffreysprompts.com-f3zc","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-12T06:24:56.158090338Z","created_by":"ubuntu","metadata":"","thread_id":""}]}

{"id":"jeffreysprompts.com-3fms","title":"Add visual separation between Featured and Browse sections","description":"# Task: Clarify Featured vs Browse Section Boundary\n\n## Problem Statement\nCurrently, the Featured section appears immediately after the Hero, followed by the filter controls and browse grid. This creates confusion because:\n\n1. **Filters don't affect featured**: User applies a filter, sees 6 featured prompts unchanged, thinks filtering is broken\n2. **No visual boundary**: Featured and Browse blend together\n3. **Duplicated prompts**: Featured prompts may appear again in the browse grid\n\n## Current Layout\n```\nHero (search + category pills)\n    ↓\nFeatured Prompts (6 cards, unaffected by filters)\n    ↓\nFilter Controls (Category, Tags, Clear)\n    ↓\nResults Header (\"All Prompts\" / \"Search Results\")\n    ↓\nBrowse Grid (filtered results)\n```\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### Option A: Move Featured Above Filters, Add Clear Separator\n```tsx\n{/* Hero */}\n<Hero ... />\n\n{/* Featured Section - clearly labeled, visually distinct */}\n<section className=\"py-8 border-b border-neutral-200 dark:border-neutral-800\">\n  <div className=\"container-wide\">\n    <div className=\"flex items-center justify-between mb-4\">\n      <h2 className=\"text-lg font-semibold flex items-center gap-2\">\n        <Sparkles className=\"w-5 h-5 text-amber-500\" />\n        Featured Prompts\n      </h2>\n      <span className=\"text-sm text-neutral-500\">\n        Curated by the team\n      </span>\n    </div>\n    <FeaturedPromptsSection ... />\n  </div>\n</section>\n\n{/* Clear visual break */}\n<div className=\"h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-neutral-200 dark:via-neutral-800 to-transparent\" />\n\n{/* Browse Section - with filters */}\n<section className=\"py-8\">\n  <div className=\"container-wide\">\n    <h2 className=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-6\">Browse All Prompts</h2>\n    <FilterControls ... />\n    <PromptGrid ... />\n  </div>\n</section>\n```\n\n### Option B: Integrate Featured into Results\nRemove separate featured section. Instead:\n- Add \"Featured\" badge to featured prompts in the grid\n- Sort featured prompts to top by default\n- Filters affect all prompts including featured\n\n```tsx\n// In PromptGrid or page.tsx\nconst sortedPrompts = useMemo(() => {\n  // Featured first, then the rest\n  const featured = filteredPrompts.filter(p => p.featured);\n  const nonFeatured = filteredPrompts.filter(p => !p.featured);\n  return [...featured, ...nonFeatured];\n}, [filteredPrompts]);\n```\n\n### Option C: Collapsible Featured Section (Best of Both)\nShow featured by default, allow collapsing:\n```tsx\nconst [showFeatured, setShowFeatured] = useState(true);\n\n<Collapsible open={showFeatured} onOpenChange={setShowFeatured}>\n  <CollapsibleTrigger className=\"flex items-center justify-between w-full py-4\">\n    <div className=\"flex items-center gap-2\">\n      <Sparkles className=\"w-5 h-5 text-amber-500\" />\n      <span className=\"font-semibold\">Featured Prompts</span>\n      <Badge variant=\"secondary\">{featuredCount}</Badge>\n    </div>\n    <ChevronDown className={cn(\"w-4 h-4 transition-transform\", showFeatured && \"rotate-180\")} />\n  </CollapsibleTrigger>\n  <CollapsibleContent>\n    <FeaturedPromptsSection ... />\n  </CollapsibleContent>\n</Collapsible>\n```\n\n## Recommended Approach\n**Option A** is simplest and clearest:\n- Distinct visual sections with clear labels\n- Gradient separator creates elegant break\n- \"Curated by the team\" explains why they're special\n- Users understand filters apply only to \"Browse\" section\n\n## Implementation Details\n1. Add section wrapper with border-bottom to FeaturedPromptsSection\n2. Add \"Browse All Prompts\" heading above filter controls\n3. Add subtle gradient divider between sections\n4. Consider adding \"(not affected by filters)\" note near Featured heading\n\n## Testing\n1. Apply category filter - featured section unchanged, browse section filtered\n2. Verify visual separation is clear in both light/dark modes\n3. Screen reader: sections are announced as distinct regions\n4. Mobile: sections stack correctly\n\n## Files to Modify\n- apps/web/src/app/page.tsx\n- apps/web/src/components/landing/FeaturedPromptsSection.tsx (possibly)\n\n## Dependencies\n- Should be done after color consistency (page.tsx)\n- Affects layout, may need responsive testing","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-12T05:47:27.281567949Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-12T07:46:09.758005579Z","closed_at":"2026-01-12T07:46:09.758005579Z","close_reason":"Implemented Option A: Added 'Featured Prompts' title with 'Curated by the team' subtitle, border-bottom on Featured section, gradient divider between sections, 'Browse All Prompts' section heading, and contextual results count.

{"id":"jeffreysprompts.com-4q8k","title":"EPIC: CLI Authentication & Premium Integration","description":"## Overview\nAdd optional authentication to the `jfp` CLI tool, allowing users to seamlessly access their premium account data including custom prompts, collections, saved/bookmarked prompts, and notes.\n\n## Why This Matters\nThe CLI is the primary interface for power users and AI agents. By adding authentication:\n- Premium users get their full library in the CLI\n- Users can access their collections and saved prompts\n- The \"swap meet\" community prompts become available\n- Notes and annotations sync across devices\n- Search spans all content (public + personal)\n\n## Design Principles\n\n### 1. Transparent for Non-Users\n- All existing functionality works WITHOUT login\n- No nag screens, no forced auth, no degraded experience\n- Login is purely additive - it unlocks MORE, never restricts\n- Clear, honest messaging about what premium provides\n\n### 2. Works Everywhere\n- Local machines: Browser-based OAuth with auto-callback\n- Remote/SSH: Device code flow (6-character code)\n- Headless servers: Same device code flow\n- CI/CD: Token-based auth via environment variable\n\n### 3. Secure & Private\n- Tokens stored securely in user's config directory\n- Short-lived access tokens with refresh capability\n- No passwords stored locally\n- Easy revocation via web dashboard\n\n## Authentication Flows\n\n### Flow 1: Local Machine (Default)\n```\nUser runs: jfp login\n    ↓\nCLI starts local HTTP server on random port (e.g., 19847)\n    ↓\nCLI opens browser to: https://premium.jeffreysprompts.com/cli/auth?port=19847\n    ↓\nUser completes Google OAuth on premium site\n    ↓\nPremium site redirects to: http://localhost:19847/callback?token=xxx\n    ↓\nCLI receives token, stores it, shows success message\n    ↓\nLocal server shuts down\n```\n\n### Flow 2: Remote Machine (--remote or auto-detected)\n```\nUser runs: jfp login --remote  (or CLI detects no display)\n    ↓\nCLI requests device code from: POST /api/cli/device-code\n    ↓\nAPI returns: { device_code: \"abc123\", user_code: \"XYZW-1234\", verification_url: \"...\" }\n    ↓\nCLI shows: \"Visit https://premium.jeffreysprompts.com/cli/verify and enter code: XYZW-1234\"\n    ↓\nUser visits URL, logs in with Google, enters code\n    ↓\nMeanwhile, CLI polls: POST /api/cli/device-token with device_code\n    ↓\nOnce user completes, API returns access token\n    ↓\nCLI stores token, shows success\n```\n\n### Flow 3: CI/CD / Programmatic\n```\nUser sets: JFP_TOKEN=xxx in environment\n    ↓\nCLI detects env var, uses it for all authenticated requests\n    ↓\nNo interactive login needed\n```\n\n## New CLI Commands\n\n### `jfp login`\n- Initiates authentication flow\n- Options: `--remote` (force device code flow)\n- Stores credentials in `~/.config/jfp/credentials.json`\n\n### `jfp logout`\n- Clears stored credentials\n- Optionally revokes token on server\n\n### `jfp whoami`\n- Shows current authentication status\n- Displays: email, tier, token expiry\n\n### `jfp list --mine`\n- Lists only user's custom prompts\n\n### `jfp list --saved`\n- Lists user's bookmarked/saved prompts\n\n### `jfp collections`\n- Lists user's collections\n- `jfp collections <name>` shows prompts in collection\n\n### `jfp notes <prompt-id>`\n- Shows notes for a prompt\n- `jfp notes <prompt-id> --add \"note text\"` adds a note\n\n## API Endpoints Needed (Premium Site)\n\n### Auth Endpoints\n- `POST /api/cli/device-code` - Initiate device code flow\n- `POST /api/cli/device-token` - Exchange device code for token\n- `POST /api/cli/token/refresh` - Refresh access token\n- `POST /api/cli/token/revoke` - Revoke token (logout)\n\n### Data Endpoints (Authenticated)\n- `GET /api/cli/me` - Current user info\n- `GET /api/cli/prompts` - All prompts (public + user's)\n- `GET /api/cli/prompts/mine` - User's custom prompts only\n- `GET /api/cli/prompts/saved` - User's saved/bookmarked prompts\n- `GET /api/cli/collections` - User's collections\n- `GET /api/cli/collections/:id` - Collection details with prompts\n- `GET /api/cli/notes/:promptId` - Notes for a prompt\n- `POST /api/cli/notes/:promptId` - Add note to prompt\n\n## Token Format\nUsing JWT with claims:\n- `sub`: User ID\n- `email`: User email\n- `tier`: Subscription tier (free/premium)\n- `exp`: Expiration time\n- `iat`: Issued at time\n\n## Credential Storage\nLocation: `~/.config/jfp/credentials.json`\n```json\n{\n  \"access_token\": \"eyJ...\",\n  \"refresh_token\": \"xxx\",\n  \"expires_at\": \"2024-01-15T10:30:00Z\",\n  \"email\": \"user@example.com\",\n  \"tier\": \"premium\"\n}\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n- `jfp login` works on local machines with browser\n- `jfp login --remote` works on headless/SSH machines\n- Authenticated users see their prompts in `jfp list`\n- `jfp search` finds results in personal prompts\n- Token refresh happens automatically\n- Logout clears all credentials\n- Non-authenticated users have identical experience to before","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-11T01:08:45.460885074Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-11T02:21:13.730928394Z","closed_at":"2026-01-11T02:21:13.730928394Z","close_reason":"All CLI Authentication & Premium Integration features implemented: login (browser + device code), logout, whoami, save, notes, collections, list --mine/--saved, search --mine/--saved/--all/--local. 277 tests passing.","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0}

Pro is optional and adds personal features like bookmarks, notes, and early-access prompts.\n\n## Implementation Notes\n- Use existing UI primitives (Card/Callout/Banner) to stay consistent.\n- Avoid new dependencies or complex layout.\n- If there’s a `MarketingSection` or similar component, place the teaser there.\n- Keep typography smaller than hero content.\n\n## Accessibility\n- Ensure heading uses appropriate semantic level (e.g., `h3`).\n- Button should be keyboard focusable and have adequate contrast.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- A subtle Pro teaser appears on the landing page.\n- A short FAQ entry explains free vs. Pro.\n- All links point to `https://pro.jeffreysprompts.com`.\n- No layout regression on mobile.\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-11T01:12:44.531877850Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-11T01:22:32.379728357Z","closed_at":"2026-01-11T01:22:32.379728357Z","close_reason":"Added subtle Pro teaser block and FAQ section to landing page - responsive design with accessible markup, links to pro.jeffreysprompts.com","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0}

{"id":"jeffreysprompts.com-8699","title":"Add skeleton loading to SpotlightSearch during semantic rerank","description":"# Task: Add Skeleton Loading to SpotlightSearch\n\n## Context\nWhen semantic reranking is enabled, SpotlightSearch shows BM25 results immediately then reranks them. Currently, the only feedback is \"Improving...\" text in the footer. Users may not notice results are being reordered.\n\n## Current Behavior\n1. User types query\n2. BM25 results appear immediately\n3. Footer shows \"Improving...\" with sparkle icon\n4. Results silently reorder when reranking completes\n\n## Proposed Behavior\n1. User types query\n2. Skeleton placeholders appear with shimmer effect\n3. BM25 results fade in (partial loading state)\n4. \"Improving...\" indicator visible\n5. Results smoothly reorder with animation\n6. \"Semantic\" badge replaces \"Improving...\"\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Skeleton Component for Search Results\n```tsx\nfunction SearchResultSkeleton() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"px-4 py-3 flex items-start gap-3 animate-pulse\">\n      <div className=\"flex-1 space-y-2\">\n        <div className=\"flex items-center gap-2\">\n          <div className=\"h-4 w-32 bg-neutral-200 dark:bg-neutral-700 rounded\" />\n          <div className=\"h-4 w-16 bg-neutral-100 dark:bg-neutral-800 rounded-full\" />\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"h-3 w-full bg-neutral-100 dark:bg-neutral-800 rounded\" />\n        <div className=\"flex gap-1.5 mt-1.5\">\n          <div className=\"h-4 w-12 bg-neutral-100 dark:bg-neutral-800 rounded\" />\n          <div className=\"h-4 w-14 bg-neutral-100 dark:bg-neutral-800 rounded\" />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"h-4 w-4 bg-neutral-200 dark:bg-neutral-700 rounded\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Show Skeletons During Initial Search\n```tsx\n// In the results rendering section:\n{isSearching && results.length === 0 && (\n  <div className=\"py-2\">\n    {Array.from({ length: 5 }).map((_, i) => (\n      <SearchResultSkeleton key={i} />\n    ))}\n  </div>\n)}\n```\n\n### 3. Add Reorder Animation\n```tsx\n// Wrap results in AnimatePresence with layout animation\n<AnimatePresence mode=\"popLayout\">\n  {results.map((result, index) => (\n    <motion.div\n      key={result.prompt.id}\n      layout\n      initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 10 }}\n      animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}\n      exit={{ opacity: 0, y: -10 }}\n      transition={{ duration: 0.2, delay: index * 0.02 }}\n    >\n      {/* Result button content */}\n    </motion.div>\n  ))}\n</AnimatePresence>\n```\n\n### 4. Shimmer Effect (Optional Enhancement)\n```css\n@keyframes shimmer {\n  0% { background-position: -200% 0; }\n  100% { background-position: 200% 0; }\n}\n\n.skeleton-shimmer {\n  background: linear-gradient(\n    90deg,\n    oklch(0.95 0 0) 0%,\n    oklch(0.90 0 0) 50%,\n    oklch(0.95 0 0) 100%\n  );\n  background-size: 200% 100%;\n  animation: shimmer 1.5s infinite;\n}\n```\n\n## Design Rationale\n- Skeletons communicate \"loading\" better than spinners\n- Layout animations make reordering feel smooth, not jarring\n- Staggered entrance (delay: index * 0.02) creates professional feel\n- Shimmer effect adds polish (optional)\n\n## Testing\n1. Enable semantic mode\n2. Type query - see skeletons while loading\n3. Results appear with staggered animation\n4. When reranking completes, results smoothly reorder\n5. Disable semantic mode - results still stagger in\n6. Test with prefers-reduced-motion: animations disabled\n\n## Files Modified\n- apps/web/src/components/SpotlightSearch.tsx\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires Framer Motion (already included)\n- Should match PromptGrid skeleton pattern\n- Respects reduced motion preference","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-12T05:40:58.534780914Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-12T21:35:51.996696147Z","closed_at":"2026-01-12T21:35:51.996696147Z","close_reason":"Skeleton loading and layout animations already implemented in SpotlightSearch","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"jeffreysprompts.com-8699","depends_on_id":"jeffreysprompts.com-usn5","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-12T05:43:30.625160247Z","created_by":"ubuntu","metadata":"","thread_id":""}]}

Plain text link - low visual prominence\n2. Uses indigo (inconsistent with neutral design system)\n3. Only visible when filters active (no affordance)\n4. No icon - relies entirely on text\n\n## Proposed Design\n\n### Option A: Always-visible ghost button (Recommended)\n```tsx\n<Button\n  variant=\"ghost\"\n  size=\"sm\"\n  onClick={clearFilters}\n  disabled={!hasActiveFilters}\n  className={cn(\n    \"h-8 px-3 text-sm font-medium transition-colors\",\n    hasActiveFilters\n      ? \"text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300 hover:text-neutral-900 dark:hover:text-white\"\n      : \"text-neutral-400 dark:text-neutral-600 cursor-not-allowed opacity-50\"\n  )}\n>\n  <X className=\"w-3.5 h-3.5 mr-1.5\" />\n  Clear filters\n  {hasActiveFilters && (\n    <span className=\"ml-1.5 text-xs bg-neutral-200 dark:bg-neutral-700 px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded-full\">\n      {filterCount}\n    </span>\n  )}\n</Button>\n```\n\n### Option B: Only when active, but as a proper button\n```tsx\n{hasActiveFilters && (\n  <Button\n    variant=\"outline\"\n    size=\"sm\"\n    onClick={clearFilters}\n    className=\"h-8 px-3 text-sm gap-1.5\"\n  >\n    <X className=\"w-3.5 h-3.5\" />\n    Clear ({filterCount})\n  </Button>\n)}\n```\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### Add filter count calculation\n```tsx\nconst filterCount = useMemo(() => {\n  let count = 0;\n  if (filters.query) count++;\n  if (filters.category) count++;\n  count += filters.tags.length;\n  return count;\n}, [filters]);\n```\n\n### Add accessibility\n```tsx\naria-label={`Clear all ${filterCount} active filters`}\n```\n\n## Design Rationale\n- Ghost button maintains visual hierarchy (filters are secondary to results)\n- Always visible = discoverable (disabled state indicates \"nothing to clear\")\n- Icon + text = clear meaning\n- Count badge = precise feedback\n- Matches CategoryFilter/TagFilter clear button pattern\n\n## Testing\n1. With no filters: button disabled, grayed out\n2. With 1 filter: button enabled, shows \"(1)\"\n3. With multiple: button shows count\n4. Click clears all and disables button\n5. Keyboard accessible (Tab, Enter)\n\n## Files Modified\n- apps/web/src/app/page.tsx\n\n## Dependencies\n- Should use the updated neutral color palette (do after color fix)\n- Matches pattern already used in TagFilter.tsx (Clear button)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-12T05:38:18.479565228Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-12T15:06:14.296451909Z","closed_at":"2026-01-12T15:06:14.296451909Z","close_reason":"Implementation verified complete: Button component with ghost variant, X icon, filterCount memo, aria-label, and neutral colors.

{"id":"jeffreysprompts.com-awcp","title":"Add swipe gesture hints for first-time mobile users","description":"# Task: Add Swipe Gesture Hints\n\n## Context\nSwipeablePromptCard has powerful swipe gestures (left to copy, right to basket) that users never discover because there's no visual indication they exist.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### 1. First-Card Hint Overlay\nShow a one-time hint on the first prompt card:\n\n```tsx\n// SwipeHint.tsx\nexport function SwipeHint({ onDismiss }: { onDismiss: () => void }) {\n  return (\n    <motion.div\n      initial={{ opacity: 0 }}\n      animate={{ opacity: 1 }}\n      exit={{ opacity: 0 }}\n      className=\"absolute inset-0 z-20 flex items-center justify-center bg-black/60 rounded-xl backdrop-blur-sm\"\n    >\n      <div className=\"text-center text-white px-6\">\n        <div className=\"flex items-center justify-center gap-8 mb-4\">\n          {/* Left swipe indicator */}\n          <div className=\"flex items-center gap-2\">\n            <ArrowLeft className=\"w-5 h-5 animate-pulse\" />\n            <span className=\"text-sm font-medium\">Copy</span>\n          </div>\n          \n          {/* Right swipe indicator */}\n          <div className=\"flex items-center gap-2\">\n            <span className=\"text-sm font-medium\">Basket</span>\n            <ArrowRight className=\"w-5 h-5 animate-pulse\" />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        \n        <p className=\"text-xs text-white/70 mb-4\">\n          Swipe cards for quick actions\n        </p>\n        \n        <Button\n          size=\"sm\"\n          variant=\"secondary\"\n          onClick={onDismiss}\n          className=\"text-xs\"\n        >\n          Got it\n        </Button>\n      </div>\n    </motion.div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Persist Dismissal in localStorage\n```tsx\nconst SWIPE_HINT_KEY = \"jfp-swipe-hint-dismissed\";\n\nfunction useSwipeHint() {\n  const [showHint, setShowHint] = useLocalStorage(SWIPE_HINT_KEY, true);\n  \n  const dismissHint = useCallback(() => {\n    setShowHint(false);\n  }, [setShowHint]);\n  \n  return { showHint, dismissHint };\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Integration in SwipeablePromptCard\n```tsx\nexport function SwipeablePromptCard({ prompt, index, ...props }) {\n  const { showHint, dismissHint } = useSwipeHint();\n  const shouldShowHint = showHint && index === 0; // Only first card\n  \n  return (\n    <div className=\"relative\">\n      <PromptCard ... />\n      \n      <AnimatePresence>\n        {shouldShowHint && isMobile && (\n          <SwipeHint onDismiss={dismissHint} />\n        )}\n      </AnimatePresence>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Subtle Edge Indicators (Alternative/Additional)\nAdd permanent but subtle visual cues on card edges:\n\n```tsx\n{/* Left edge - Copy hint */}\n<div className=\"absolute left-0 top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 w-1 h-12 rounded-r-full bg-sky-400/30\" />\n\n{/* Right edge - Basket hint */}\n<div className=\"absolute right-0 top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 w-1 h-12 rounded-l-full bg-indigo-400/30\" />\n```\n\n## Design Rationale\n- One-time overlay: Teaches without being annoying\n- \"Got it\" button: Gives user control\n- localStorage persistence: Never shows again\n- Only first card: Minimal disruption\n- Edge indicators (optional): Permanent subtle hints\n\n## Testing\n1. Fresh localStorage: hint shows on first card\n2. Dismiss hint: never shows again\n3. Different device: shows again (different localStorage)\n4. Desktop: hint never shows\n5. Verify hint doesn't block actual interaction\n\n## Files Modified\n- apps/web/src/components/mobile/SwipeablePromptCard.tsx\n- New: apps/web/src/components/mobile/SwipeHint.tsx (optional)\n- apps/web/src/hooks/useSwipeHint.ts (optional)\n\n## Dependencies\n- Should use neutral color palette\n- Requires framer-motion for animations\n- Uses useLocalStorage hook (already exists)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-12T05:39:35.502604504Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-12T18:35:58.627181708Z","closed_at":"2026-01-12T18:35:58.627181708Z","close_reason":"Created SwipeHint component with animated arrows, useSwipeHint hook for localStorage persistence.

{"id":"jeffreysprompts.com-bnc3","title":"Add keyboard alternatives for mobile swipe actions","description":"# Task: Add Keyboard Alternatives for Swipe Actions\n\n## Context\nSwipeablePromptCard has powerful touch gestures (swipe left/right, long-press, double-tap) that are completely inaccessible to keyboard users. While these are mobile-optimized, keyboard users on desktop need equivalent access.\n\n## Current Mobile-Only Actions\n1. **Swipe left**: Copy prompt to clipboard\n2. **Swipe right**: Add to basket\n3. **Double-tap**: Save/favorite\n4. **Long-press**: Open quick actions menu\n\n## Desktop Already Has\n- Copy button on PromptCard ✓\n- View button opens modal with all actions ✓\n\n## Missing Keyboard Equivalents\nThe PromptCard (desktop) is missing:\n1. **Add to basket** button (only available via swipe or modal)\n2. **Save/favorite** functionality (not implemented on desktop)\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### Option A: Add Basket Button to PromptCard Footer (Recommended)\n```tsx\n// PromptCard.tsx - Add basket button next to Copy\n<div className=\"flex items-center gap-2\">\n  <Button\n    size=\"sm\"\n    variant=\"ghost\"\n    className=\"h-8 px-2\"\n    onClick={handleAddToBasket}\n    disabled={isInBasket}\n    aria-label={isInBasket ? \"Already in basket\" : \"Add to basket\"}\n  >\n    {isInBasket ? (\n      <Check className=\"w-4 h-4 text-emerald-500\" aria-hidden=\"true\" />\n    ) : (\n      <ShoppingBasket className=\"w-4 h-4\" aria-hidden=\"true\" />\n    )}\n  </Button>\n  \n  {/* Existing Copy button */}\n  <Button ... />\n  \n  {/* Existing View button */}\n  <Button ... />\n</div>\n```\n\n### Option B: Keyboard Shortcut on Card Focus\nAdd keyboard shortcuts when card is focused:\n```tsx\nconst handleKeyDown = useCallback((e: React.KeyboardEvent) => {\n  switch (e.key) {\n    case 'c':\n      if (e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey) {\n        e.preventDefault();\n        handleCopy();\n      }\n      break;\n    case 'b':\n      if (e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey) {\n        e.preventDefault();\n        handleAddToBasket();\n      }\n      break;\n  }\n}, [handleCopy, handleAddToBasket]);\n\n<Card \n  tabIndex={0} \n  onKeyDown={handleKeyDown}\n  role=\"article\"\n  aria-label={prompt.title}\n>\n```\n\n### Option C: Context Menu on Right-Click\n```tsx\nconst handleContextMenu = useCallback((e: React.MouseEvent) => {\n  e.preventDefault();\n  // Show custom context menu with Copy, Add to Basket, etc.\n}, []);\n\n<Card onContextMenu={handleContextMenu}>\n```\n\n## Recommended Approach\n**Option A** is simplest and most discoverable:\n- Visual button = no learning curve\n- Keyboard accessible by default (Tab + Enter)\n- Consistent with existing UI pattern\n\n**Consider also adding Option B** for power users who want speed.\n\n## Implementation for Option A\n\n### 1. Add basket hook to PromptCard\n```tsx\nimport { useBasket } from \"@/hooks/use-basket\";\n\nexport function PromptCard({ prompt, ... }) {\n  const { addItem, isInBasket } = useBasket();\n  const inBasket = isInBasket(prompt.id);\n  \n  const handleAddToBasket = useCallback((e: MouseEvent) => {\n    e.stopPropagation();\n    if (!inBasket) {\n      addItem(prompt.id);\n      success(\"Added to basket\", prompt.title);\n    }\n  }, [prompt, inBasket, addItem, success]);\n  \n  // ... render basket button in footer\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Update button group layout\nCurrent: Copy | View\nNew: Basket | Copy | View\n\nMay need to adjust button sizes or use icon-only for all three:\n```tsx\n<div className=\"flex items-center gap-1\">\n  <Button size=\"sm\" variant=\"ghost\" className=\"h-8 w-8 p-0\" ...>\n    <ShoppingBasket className=\"w-4 h-4\" />\n  </Button>\n  <Button size=\"sm\" variant=\"ghost\" className=\"h-8 w-8 p-0\" ...>\n    <Copy className=\"w-4 h-4\" />\n  </Button>\n  <Button size=\"sm\" className=\"h-8 px-3\" ...>\n    View\n    <ChevronRight className=\"w-4 h-4 ml-1\" />\n  </Button>\n</div>\n```\n\n## Testing\n1. Tab to PromptCard - focus visible\n2. Tab through buttons - all accessible\n3. Enter on basket button - adds to basket\n4. Enter on basket button again - shows \"already in basket\" state\n5. Verify with screen reader\n\n## Files Modified\n- apps/web/src/components/PromptCard.tsx\n\n## Dependencies\n- Uses useBasket hook (already exists)\n- Should be done after color consistency\n- Requires updating button layout","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-12T05:42:53.367987142Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-12T07:38:33.686090522Z","closed_at":"2026-01-12T07:38:33.686090522Z","close_reason":"Added basket button to PromptCard with keyboard accessibility","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"jeffreysprompts.com-bnc3","depends_on_id":"jeffreysprompts.com-s6ex","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-12T05:43:40.960924411Z","created_by":"ubuntu","metadata":"","thread_id":""}]}

The CLI should:\n1. Detect when access token is expired (or about to expire)\n2. Automatically use refresh token to get new access token\n3. Only prompt for re-login when refresh token also expires (30 days)\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Update `packages/cli/src/lib/credentials.ts`\n\n```typescript\nconst PREMIUM_URL = process.env.JFP_PREMIUM_URL ?? \"https://premium.jeffreysprompts.com\";\n\n/**\n * Get a valid access token, refreshing if necessary\n * Returns null if not logged in or refresh fails\n */\nexport async function getValidAccessToken(): Promise<string | null> {\n  // Check environment variable first (CI/CD)\n  const envToken = process.env.JFP_TOKEN;\n  if (envToken) {\n    return envToken;\n  }\n  \n  const creds = await loadCredentials();\n  if (!creds) {\n    return null;\n  }\n  \n  // If not expired, return current token\n  if (!isExpired(creds)) {\n    return creds.access_token;\n  }\n  \n  // Try to refresh\n  if (creds.refresh_token) {\n    const refreshed = await refreshAccessToken(creds.refresh_token);\n    if (refreshed) {\n      // Save new credentials\n      await saveCredentials(refreshed);\n      return refreshed.access_token;\n    }\n  }\n  \n  // Refresh failed or no refresh token\n  return null;\n}\n\n/**\n * Attempt to refresh the access token\n */\nasync function refreshAccessToken(refreshToken: string): Promise<Credentials | null> {\n  try {\n    const response = await fetch(`${PREMIUM_URL}/api/cli/token/refresh`, {\n      method: \"POST\",\n      headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n      body: JSON.stringify({\n        refresh_token: refreshToken,\n        client_id: \"jfp-cli\",\n      }),\n    });\n    \n    if (!response.ok) {\n      // Refresh failed - token likely expired or revoked\n      return null;\n    }\n    \n    const data = await response.json();\n    \n    return {\n      access_token: data.access_token,\n      refresh_token: data.refresh_token,\n      expires_at: data.expires_at,\n      email: data.email,\n      tier: data.tier,\n      user_id: data.user_id,\n    };\n  } catch {\n    // Network error - return null to fail gracefully\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n\n/**\n * Check if credentials need refresh (expired or expiring soon)\n */\nexport function needsRefresh(creds: Credentials): boolean {\n  if (!creds.expires_at) return false;\n  \n  const expiresAt = new Date(creds.expires_at);\n  const now = new Date();\n  \n  // Refresh if expiring within 5 minutes\n  const bufferMs = 5 * 60 * 1000;\n  return now.getTime() > expiresAt.getTime() - bufferMs;\n}\n```\n\n### Update API Client\n\nThe API client should use `getValidAccessToken()` instead of directly reading credentials:\n\n```typescript\n// packages/cli/src/lib/api-client.ts\nimport { getValidAccessToken, isLoggedIn } from \"./credentials\";\n\nexport async function authenticatedFetch(\n  url: string,\n  options: RequestInit = {}\n): Promise<Response> {\n  const token = await getValidAccessToken();\n  \n  const headers = new Headers(options.headers);\n  if (token) {\n    headers.set(\"Authorization\", `Bearer ${token}`);\n  }\n  \n  return fetch(url, {\n    ...options,\n    headers,\n  });\n}\n```\n\n## User Experience\n- If token refreshes successfully: User never notices, command works\n- If refresh fails: User sees \"Session expired. Please run 'jfp login' to sign in again.\"\n- Never show technical error details to user\n\n## Logging\nAdd debug logging for troubleshooting:\n```typescript\nif (process.env.JFP_DEBUG) {\n  console.error(\"[jfp] Access token expired, attempting refresh...\");\n  console.error(\"[jfp] Refresh successful, new token expires:\", creds.expires_at);\n}\n```\n\n## Verification\n- Token auto-refreshes before expiry\n- Commands continue working after refresh\n- Clear error message when refresh fails\n- JFP_DEBUG shows refresh activity","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-11T01:19:43.451531077Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-11T01:30:53.342754479Z","closed_at":"2026-01-11T01:30:53.342754479Z","close_reason":"Implemented automatic token refresh in CLI with authenticatedFetch() wrapper, needsRefresh() helper, and comprehensive tests (46 tests pass)","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0}

Our current implementation is functionally complete but lacks the subtle animations and feedback that make interfaces feel \"premium.\"\n\n### Missing Polish Elements\n\n#### 1. Loading States\n- **SpotlightSearch**: Shows \"Improving...\" text during semantic rerank, but no skeleton or visual feedback for the actual results\n- **Filter changes**: Results snap instantly (no transition)\n- **Basket operations**: Export button becomes disabled but no progress indicator\n\n#### 2. Content Transitions\n- When filtering, results appear/disappear instantly\n- No fade transitions between states\n- Modal open/close is smooth, but content inside isn't staggered\n\n#### 3. Micro-interactions\n- Basket items have no entrance animation when added\n- Hover states on some elements are too subtle\n- Copy button changes icon but could have more satisfying feedback\n- No celebration moments (e.g., when all prompts copied)\n\n#### 4. Visual Feedback Gaps\n- No skeleton loading for SpotlightSearch during rerank\n- Filter count doesn't animate when changing\n- Basket badge count doesn't animate\n\n## Stripe/Linear Examples to Emulate\n1. **Skeleton loading**: Shimmer effect on placeholders\n2. **Staggered entrances**: Cards animate in with slight delay\n3. **State transitions**: Smooth crossfade between loading/loaded/empty\n4. **Hover micro-animations**: Subtle scale or shadow changes\n5. **Action feedback**: Button press effects, checkmark animations\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] SpotlightSearch shows skeleton during rerank\n- [ ] Filter changes have subtle fade transition\n- [ ] Basket items animate on add/remove\n- [ ] Copy success has satisfying visual feedback\n- [ ] All animations respect prefers-reduced-motion\n\n## Design Principles\n- Subtle > Flashy (animations should enhance, not distract)\n- Fast > Slow (keep durations under 300ms for most)\n- Purposeful (every animation should communicate state)\n- Accessible (reduced motion support)\n\n## Dependencies\n- Should be done AFTER color consistency and UX improvements\n- These are enhancements, not critical fixes\n\n## Estimated Scope\n- 5-6 files to modify\n- Medium complexity (Framer Motion knowledge required)\n- Lower priority than functional UX fixes","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-12T05:40:28.280178744Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-12T15:16:50.563316003Z","closed_at":"2026-01-12T15:16:50.563316003Z","close_reason":"Epic complete: copy button animations, basket item animations, and accessibility (prefers-reduced-motion) all implemented","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0}

{"id":"jeffreysprompts.com-f7wf","title":"Add fade transitions when filter results change","description":"# Task: Add Fade Transitions for Filter Changes\n\n## Context\nWhen users apply or remove filters, the PromptGrid results snap instantly. This feels abrupt compared to the smooth card entrance animations. Stripe/Linear use subtle crossfades for content changes.\n\n## Current Behavior\n1. User clicks category filter\n2. Results instantly swap (jarring)\n3. New cards animate in (but old ones just disappear)\n\n## Proposed Behavior\n1. User clicks category filter\n2. Current results fade out slightly (100ms)\n3. New results fade in with staggered animation\n4. Smooth transition feels intentional\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Option A: Layout Animation (Recommended)\nUse Framer Motion's layout animation on the grid:\n\n```tsx\n// PromptGrid.tsx\n<motion.div \n  className=\"grid gap-6 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4\"\n  layout\n>\n  <AnimatePresence mode=\"popLayout\">\n    {prompts.map((prompt, index) => (\n      <motion.div\n        key={prompt.id}\n        layout\n        initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.95 }}\n        animate={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1 }}\n        exit={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.95 }}\n        transition={{ \n          duration: 0.2,\n          delay: Math.min(index * 0.03, 0.15) // Cap delay at 150ms\n        }}\n      >\n        <PromptCard prompt={prompt} index={index} ... />\n      </motion.div>\n    ))}\n  </AnimatePresence>\n</motion.div>\n```\n\n### Option B: Simple Fade Wrapper\nWrap the entire grid in a fade container that triggers on filter change:\n\n```tsx\n// page.tsx\nconst [isTransitioning, setIsTransitioning] = useState(false);\nconst prevFilters = useRef(filters);\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n  if (JSON.stringify(prevFilters.current) !== JSON.stringify(filters)) {\n    setIsTransitioning(true);\n    setTimeout(() => setIsTransitioning(false), 100);\n    prevFilters.current = filters;\n  }\n}, [filters]);\n\n<motion.div\n  animate={{ opacity: isTransitioning ? 0.5 : 1 }}\n  transition={{ duration: 0.1 }}\n>\n  <PromptGrid prompts={filteredPrompts} ... />\n</motion.div>\n```\n\n### Option C: CSS-Only Transition\nAdd CSS transition to the grid container:\n\n```css\n.prompt-grid {\n  transition: opacity 0.15s ease-out;\n}\n\n.prompt-grid.transitioning {\n  opacity: 0.5;\n}\n```\n\n## Recommended Approach\n**Option A** is best for Stripe-level polish because:\n- Individual card animations look premium\n- Layout animation handles position changes\n- AnimatePresence properly exits old cards\n- Staggered delay creates cascade effect\n\n## Design Rationale\n- Transitions acknowledge user action\n- Fade suggests \"content is changing\"\n- Stagger creates sense of order\n- Fast durations (< 200ms) feel responsive\n\n## Testing\n1.

{"id":"jeffreysprompts.com-fjw1","title":"Add basket item add/remove animations","description":"# Task: Animate Basket Item Add/Remove\n\n## Context\nWhen items are added to or removed from the basket, they appear/disappear instantly. This feels abrupt compared to the smooth card animations elsewhere. Stripe/Linear use subtle animations for list changes.\n\n## Current Behavior\n- Add item: Appears instantly at end of list\n- Remove item: Disappears instantly\n- Count badge: Updates without animation\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### 1. List Item Animation (BasketSidebar.tsx)\n```typescript\nimport { motion, AnimatePresence } from 'framer-motion';\n\n// Wrap basket items in AnimatePresence\n<div className=\"space-y-2\">\n  <AnimatePresence mode=\"popLayout\">\n    {basketItems.map((item, index) => (\n      <motion.div\n        key={item.id}\n        layout\n        initial={{ opacity: 0, x: -20, height: 0 }}\n        animate={{ opacity: 1, x: 0, height: 'auto' }}\n        exit={{ opacity: 0, x: 20, height: 0 }}\n        transition={{ \n          duration: 0.2,\n          delay: index * 0.03, // Stagger for multiple adds\n          ease: [0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1]\n        }}\n      >\n        <BasketItemRow item={item} ... />\n      </motion.div>\n    ))}\n  </AnimatePresence>\n</div>\n```\n\n### 2. Badge Count Animation (Nav.tsx or BasketSidebar.tsx)\n```typescript\n// Animated counter for basket badge\nconst [displayCount, setDisplayCount] = useState(count);\nconst springCount = useSpring(count, { stiffness: 300, damping: 30 });\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n  return springCount.onChange(latest => {\n    setDisplayCount(Math.round(latest));\n  });\n}, [springCount]);\n\n// Or simpler: scale animation on change\n<motion.span\n  key={count} // Remount on change triggers animation\n  initial={{ scale: 1.5, opacity: 0 }}\n  animate={{ scale: 1, opacity: 1 }}\n  transition={{ duration: 0.2 }}\n  className=\"...\"\n>\n  {count}\n</motion.span>\n```\n\n### 3. Add Success Feedback\n```typescript\n// Flash effect when item added\nconst [justAdded, setJustAdded] = useState<string | null>(null);\n\nconst handleAdd = (id: string) => {\n  addToBasket(id);\n  setJustAdded(id);\n  setTimeout(() => setJustAdded(null), 1000);\n};\n\n// In list:\n<motion.div\n  className={cn(\n    \"...\",\n    justAdded === item.id && \"ring-2 ring-emerald-500\"\n  )}\n  animate={justAdded === item.id ? { \n    backgroundColor: ['var(--emerald-50)', 'transparent'] \n  } : {}}\n>\n```\n\n## Design Rationale\n- Slide in from left: Suggests item came from the content area\n- Slide out to right: Suggests item is being dismissed\n- Layout animation: Other items smoothly reposition\n- Stagger delay: Multiple adds feel organized, not chaotic\n- Badge pulse: Draws attention to count change\n\n## Reduced Motion Support\n```typescript\nconst prefersReducedMotion = useReducedMotion();\n\nconst itemVariants = prefersReducedMotion \n  ? { initial: {}, animate: {}, exit: {} }\n  : { initial: { opacity: 0, x: -20 }, ... };\n```\n\n## Testing\n1. Add item - slides in from left with fade\n2. Remove item - slides out to right with fade\n3. Add multiple - staggered entrance\n4. Badge count - subtle pulse on change\n5. Reduced motion - instant changes, no animation\n6. Empty state transition - smooth crossfade\n\n## Files Modified\n- apps/web/src/components/BasketSidebar.tsx\n- apps/web/src/components/Nav.tsx (badge animation)\n\n## Dependencies\n- Framer Motion (already available)\n- Should be done after color consistency fixes","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-12T06:09:33.777021051Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-12T15:16:43.735469944Z","closed_at":"2026-01-12T15:16:43.735469944Z","close_reason":"Implemented satisfying micro-interactions with spring animations, background flash, and haptic feedback","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"jeffreysprompts.com-fjw1","depends_on_id":"jeffreysprompts.com-f3zc","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-12T06:24:51.005541395Z","created_by":"ubuntu","metadata":"","thread_id":""}]}

Keep both repos in sync.\n\n## Task\nImplement dark mode with system preference detection and user override.\n\n## Why This Matters\nFrom README: \"We optimize for an elite UX across desktop and mobile.\"\nDark mode is essential for:\n- User comfort in low-light environments\n- Modern, polished appearance\n- Accessibility (some users need high contrast)\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Theme Provider\n```typescript\n// src/components/providers/theme-provider.tsx\n\"use client\";\n\nimport { createContext, useContext, useEffect, useState } from \"react\";\n\ntype Theme = \"light\" | \"dark\" | \"system\";\n\ninterface ThemeContextType {\n  theme: Theme;\n  setTheme: (theme: Theme) => void;\n  resolvedTheme: \"light\" | \"dark\";\n}\n\nexport function ThemeProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  const [theme, setTheme] = useState<Theme>(\"system\");\n  const [resolvedTheme, setResolvedTheme] = useState<\"light\" | \"dark\">(\"light\");\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const stored = localStorage.getItem(\"theme\") as Theme;\n    if (stored) setTheme(stored);\n  }, []);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const mediaQuery = window.matchMedia(\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\");\n    const updateResolved = () => {\n      const resolved = theme === \"system\" \n        ? (mediaQuery.matches ? \"dark\" : \"light\")\n        : theme;\n      setResolvedTheme(resolved);\n      document.documentElement.classList.toggle(\"dark\", resolved === \"dark\");\n    };\n    \n    updateResolved();\n    mediaQuery.addEventListener(\"change\", updateResolved);\n    return () => mediaQuery.removeEventListener(\"change\", updateResolved);\n  }, [theme]);\n\n  return (\n    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme, resolvedTheme }}>\n      {children}\n    </ThemeContext.Provider>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Theme Toggle Component\n```typescript\n// src/components/ui/theme-toggle.tsx\nexport function ThemeToggle() {\n  const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme();\n  return (\n    <DropdownMenu>\n      <DropdownMenuTrigger asChild>\n        <Button variant=\"ghost\" size=\"icon\">\n          <Sun className=\"h-5 w-5 dark:hidden\" />\n          <Moon className=\"h-5 w-5 hidden dark:block\" />\n        </Button>\n      </DropdownMenuTrigger>\n      <DropdownMenuContent>\n        <DropdownMenuItem onClick={() => setTheme(\"light\")}>Light</DropdownMenuItem>\n        <DropdownMenuItem onClick={() => setTheme(\"dark\")}>Dark</DropdownMenuItem>\n        <DropdownMenuItem onClick={() => setTheme(\"system\")}>System</DropdownMenuItem>\n      </DropdownMenuContent>\n    </DropdownMenu>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 3. CSS Variables (in globals.css)\nAlready implemented in scaffold:\n```css\n:root {\n  --background: #ffffff;\n  --foreground: #0a0a0a;\n  /* ... */\n}\n\n.dark {\n  --background: #0a0a0a;\n  --foreground: #ededed;\n  /* ... */\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Prevent Flash of Wrong Theme\n```typescript\n// In layout.tsx <head>\n<script dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{\n  __html: `\n    (function() {\n      const stored = localStorage.getItem('theme');\n      const prefersDark = window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches;\n      const isDark = stored === 'dark' || (!stored && prefersDark);\n      if (isDark) document.documentElement.classList.add('dark');\n    })();\n  `\n}} />\n```\n\n### 5. Persist User Preference\n- Store in localStorage for immediate use\n- Sync to user_profiles.theme_preference for cross-device\n- Apply on initial load before hydration\n\n## Components to Update\n- All UI components should use CSS variables\n- Images should have dark mode variants if needed\n- Code syntax highlighting theme should switch\n- Charts/graphs should use appropriate colors\n\n## Files to Create\n- `src/components/providers/theme-provider.tsx`\n- `src/components/ui/theme-toggle.tsx`\n- `src/hooks/use-theme.ts`\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Theme toggles between light/dark/system\n- No flash of wrong theme on page load\n- Preference persists across sessions\n- All components look good in both themes\n- Follows system preference when set to \"system\"\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-11T06:17:33.085063729Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-11T09:36:24.755675240Z","closed_at":"2026-01-11T09:36:24.755675240Z","close_reason":"Already implemented: theme-provider.tsx, theme-toggle.tsx exist with full dark/light/system support","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0}

{"id":"jeffreysprompts.com-n299","title":"Implement device code flow for remote/SSH login","description":"## Task\nImplement the device code flow for `jfp login --remote` that works on headless/SSH machines.\n\n## Why\nMany power users run the CLI on remote servers via SSH where there's no browser. The device code flow:\n1. User runs `jfp login --remote` on server\n2. CLI shows a URL and 6-character code\n3. User visits URL on ANY device (phone, laptop, etc.)\n4. User enters code after authenticating\n5. CLI receives token via polling\n\nThis is the same pattern used by:\n- GitHub CLI (`gh auth login`)\n- Azure CLI (`az login`)\n- AWS SSO (`aws sso login`)\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Add to `packages/cli/src/commands/login.ts`\n\n```typescript\nconst POLL_INTERVAL = 2_000;  // Poll every 2 seconds\nconst MAX_POLL_ATTEMPTS = 60;  // 2 minutes max\n\ninterface DeviceCodeResponse {\n  device_code: string;      // Internal code for polling\n  user_code: string;        // Code user enters (e.g., \"XYZW-1234\")\n  verification_url: string; // URL to visit\n  expires_in: number;       // Seconds until expiry\n  interval: number;         // Recommended poll interval\n}\n\ninterface DeviceTokenResponse {\n  access_token: string;\n  refresh_token?: string;\n  expires_at: string;\n  email: string;\n  tier: \"free\" | \"premium\";\n  user_id: string;\n}\n\ninterface DeviceTokenError {\n  error: string;\n  error_description?: string;\n}\n\nasync function loginRemote(options: LoginOptions): Promise<void> {\n  console.log(chalk.dim(\"Initiating device code authentication...\\n\"));\n  \n  // Request device code from API\n  const deviceCodeResponse = await fetch(`${PREMIUM_URL}/api/cli/device-code`, {\n    method: \"POST\",\n    headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n    body: JSON.stringify({ client_id: \"jfp-cli\" }),\n  });\n  \n  if (!deviceCodeResponse.ok) {\n    console.log(chalk.red(\"Failed to initiate authentication\"));\n    process.exit(1);\n  }\n  \n  const { device_code, user_code, verification_url, interval } = \n    await deviceCodeResponse.json() as DeviceCodeResponse;\n  \n  // Display instructions to user\n  console.log(boxen(\n    `To sign in, visit:\\n\\n` +\n    `  ${chalk.cyan(verification_url)}\\n\\n` +\n    `And enter code:\\n\\n` +\n    `  ${chalk.bold.yellow(formatUserCode(user_code))}`,\n    { \n      padding: 1, \n      margin: 1, \n      borderStyle: \"round\",\n      title: \"Device Authentication\",\n      titleAlignment: \"center\",\n    }\n  ));\n  \n  console.log(chalk.dim(\"\\nWaiting for authentication...\"));\n  console.log(chalk.dim(\"(Press Ctrl+C to cancel)\\n\"));\n  \n  // Poll for token\n  const pollInterval = Math.max(interval * 1000, POLL_INTERVAL);\n  let attempts = 0;\n  \n  while (attempts < MAX_POLL_ATTEMPTS) {\n    await sleep(pollInterval);\n    attempts++;\n    \n    try {\n      const tokenResponse = await fetch(`${PREMIUM_URL}/api/cli/device-token`, {\n        method: \"POST\",\n        headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n        body: JSON.stringify({ \n          device_code,\n          client_id: \"jfp-cli\",\n        }),\n      });\n      \n      if (tokenResponse.ok) {\n        const credentials = await tokenResponse.json() as DeviceTokenResponse;\n        \n        // Save credentials\n        await saveCredentials({\n          access_token: credentials.access_token,\n          refresh_token: credentials.refresh_token,\n          expires_at: credentials.expires_at,\n          email: credentials.email,\n          tier: credentials.tier,\n          user_id: credentials.user_id,\n        });\n        \n        console.log(boxen(\n          `${chalk.green(\"✓\")} Logged in as ${chalk.bold(credentials.email)}\\n` +\n          `Tier: ${chalk.cyan(credentials.tier)}`,\n          { padding: 1, margin: 1, borderStyle: \"round\", borderColor: \"green\" }\n        ));\n        \n        return;\n      }\n      \n      // Check for specific errors\n      const errorBody = await tokenResponse.json() as DeviceTokenError;\n      \n      if (errorBody.error === \"authorization_pending\") {\n        // User hasn't completed auth yet, keep polling\n        process.stdout.write(\".\");\n        continue;\n      }\n      \n      if (errorBody.error === \"slow_down\") {\n        // API wants us to slow down\n        await sleep(5000);\n        continue;\n      }\n      \n      if (errorBody.error === \"expired_token\") {\n        console.log(chalk.red(\"\\n\\nDevice code expired.

Lazy Loading\n```typescript\n// Lazy load below-fold components\nconst Features = lazy(() => import('./features'));\nconst Testimonials = lazy(() => import('./testimonials'));\n\n// Use Intersection Observer\nfunction LazySection({ children }) {\n  const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(false);\n  const ref = useRef();\n  \n  useEffect(() => {\n    const observer = new IntersectionObserver(([entry]) => {\n      if (entry.isIntersecting) setIsVisible(true);\n    });\n    observer.observe(ref.current);\n    return () => observer.disconnect();\n  }, []);\n  \n  return <div ref={ref}>{isVisible ? children : <Placeholder />}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n## Monitoring\n\n### Bundle Analysis Report\n```typescript\n// Generate report on build\n// .github/workflows/bundle-size.yml\n- name: Analyze bundle\n  run: |\n    npm run build\n    npm run analyze -- --json > bundle-stats.json\n    \n- name: Comment PR with bundle size\n  uses: actions/github-script@v6\n  with:\n    script: |\n      const stats = require('./bundle-stats.json');\n      // Compare with main branch\n      // Comment on PR if increase > 5%\n```\n\n### Size Budget CI Check\n```yaml\n# Fail if bundle too large\n- name: Check bundle size\n  run: npx size-limit\n```\n\n## Optimization Checklist\n- [ ] Remove unused dependencies\n- [ ] Use dynamic imports for routes\n- [ ] Lazy load heavy components\n- [ ] Import specific functions only\n- [ ] Use next/image for images\n- [ ] Enable gzip/brotli compression\n- [ ] Preload critical resources\n- [ ] Defer non-critical scripts\n\n## Files to Create\n- .size-limit.json\n- scripts/analyze-bundle.ts\n- .github/workflows/bundle-size.yml\n- next.config.js (optimization settings)\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Initial load < 100KB gzipped\n- Lighthouse performance > 90\n- No regression in CI\n- Bundle report on each PR\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-11T06:22:33.607884904Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-12T23:13:47.854106554Z","closed_at":"2026-01-12T23:13:47.854106554Z","close_reason":"Bundle monitoring infrastructure implemented: (1) Added @next/bundle-analyzer for visual analysis (ANALYZE=true), (2) Added size-limit with baseline limits (JS: 700KB, CSS: 100KB), (3) Current bundle: 660KB JS / 41KB CSS.

BasketSidebar Remove Button (lines 223-229)\n**Current:** `h-7 w-7` = 28px\n```tsx\n<Button variant=\"ghost\" size=\"icon\" className=\"h-7 w-7 shrink-0\">\n  <X className=\"h-3 w-3\" />\n</Button>\n```\n\n**Fix:** Increase to `h-9 w-9` = 36px (or h-11 w-11 = 44px)\n```tsx\n<Button \n  variant=\"ghost\" \n  size=\"icon\" \n  className=\"h-9 w-9 shrink-0 -mr-2\" // Negative margin to maintain visual spacing\n  aria-label={`Remove ${prompt.title} from basket`}\n>\n  <X className=\"h-4 w-4\" />\n</Button>\n```\n\n### 3. SpotlightSearch Close Button (mobile, lines 497-504)\n**Current:** `size-8` = 32px\n```tsx\n<button className=\"shrink-0 size-8 rounded-lg ...\">\n```\n\n**Fix:** Already close, bump to `size-10` or `size-11`\n```tsx\n<button className=\"shrink-0 size-11 rounded-lg ...\">\n```\n\n### 4. SpotlightSearch Semantic Toggle (lines 480-494)\n**Current:** `size-8` = 32px\n**Fix:** Bump to `size-10` for touch friendliness\n\n## Pattern for Touch-Friendly Buttons\n```tsx\n// Utility class for consistent touch targets\n// Could add to globals.css:\n.touch-target {\n  @apply min-h-[44px] min-w-[44px];\n}\n\n// Or use Tailwind directly:\nclassName=\"min-h-[44px] min-w-[44px] ...\"\n```\n\n## Design Considerations\n- Larger touch targets may require layout adjustments\n- Use negative margins to maintain visual density if needed\n- Icon size should scale proportionally (but not required)\n- Consider adding `touch-manipulation` class for faster response\n\n## Visual Impact\n- SpotlightSearch category pills will be slightly taller\n- Basket remove buttons will have more breathing room\n- Overall feel: more native/mobile-friendly\n\n## Testing\n1. Test on actual mobile device (simulator isn't accurate for touch)\n2. Verify tap accuracy on category pills\n3. Check remove button in basket with full list\n4. Ensure no layout overflow issues\n5. Compare before/after screenshots\n\n## Files Modified\n- apps/web/src/components/SpotlightSearch.tsx\n- apps/web/src/components/BasketSidebar.tsx\n\n## Dependencies\n- Independent of color changes\n- May affect overall mobile layout slightly","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-12T05:40:03.618658128Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-12T18:20:08.611045100Z","closed_at":"2026-01-12T18:20:08.611045100Z","close_reason":"Fixed touch target sizes: SpotlightSearch category pills, semantic toggle, mobile close button; BasketSidebar remove button.

However, a comprehensive audit revealed that many other files still use the old `zinc-*` and `indigo-*` color schemes, creating visual inconsistency across the application.\n\n### Current State (Inconsistent)\n- **Refactored components**: Use `neutral-*` (correct)\n- **page.tsx**: Uses `zinc-*` (14 instances) + `indigo-*` (6 instances)\n- **FeaturedPromptsSection.tsx**: Uses `zinc-*` + `indigo-*`\n- **PromptDetailModal.tsx**: Uses `zinc-*` (20+ instances) + `indigo-*` (5+ instances)\n- **SpotlightSearch.tsx**: Uses `indigo-600` for selected states\n- **SwipeablePromptCard.tsx**: Uses `zinc-*` throughout\n- **BasketSidebar.tsx**: May have inconsistencies\n\n### Why This Matters\n1. **Visual cohesion**: Users perceive inconsistent colors as \"unpolished\"\n2. **Dark mode**: `zinc` and `neutral` have slightly different hue values in OKLCH\n3. **Maintainability**: Multiple color palettes = confusion for future changes\n4. **Design system integrity**: We defined `neutral-*` as the standard\n\n### Design Decision\n- **Primary text/bg**: `neutral-*` scale (consistent with Tailwind defaults)\n- **Accent colors**: Use CSS variables (`primary`, `muted`, etc.) when possible\n- **When `indigo-*` is needed**: Only for special emphasis (Pro badges, semantic search indicator)\n\n### Success Criteria\n- [ ] Zero instances of `zinc-*` in component files (except intentional use)\n- [ ] `indigo-*` only used for specific Pro/premium features\n- [ ] All interactive states use `neutral-*` palette\n- [ ] Dark mode contrast maintained (WCAG AA)\n- [ ] Build passes with no visual regressions\n\n### Files to Modify\n1. apps/web/src/app/page.tsx\n2. apps/web/src/components/landing/FeaturedPromptsSection.tsx\n3. apps/web/src/components/PromptDetailModal.tsx\n4. apps/web/src/components/SpotlightSearch.tsx\n5. apps/web/src/components/mobile/SwipeablePromptCard.tsx\n6. apps/web/src/components/BasketSidebar.tsx (if needed)\n\n### Estimated Scope\n- 6 files to modify\n- ~50-80 color class replacements\n- Low risk (visual only, no logic changes)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-12T05:34:19.746818170Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-12T07:24:03.590434935Z","closed_at":"2026-01-12T07:24:03.590434935Z","close_reason":"All 6 child tasks completed: page.tsx, FeaturedPromptsSection, PromptDetailModal, SpotlightSearch, SwipeablePromptCard, BasketSidebar.

But we should add context:\n```tsx\n<button \n  onClick={clearFilters} \n  className=\"...\"\n  aria-describedby=\"active-filter-description\"\n>\n  Clear all filters\n</button>\n\n{/* Add hidden description */}\n<span id=\"active-filter-description\" className=\"sr-only\">\n  {filterCount} filter{filterCount !== 1 ?

These tests will catch any regression where someone accidentally uses zinc-* or improperly uses indigo-*.\n\n## IMPORTANT: Test-First Approach\nCreate these tests BEFORE implementing color changes. Tests will initially FAIL (detecting existing zinc usage), then PASS after migration is complete. This validates the migration worked.\n\n## Test Types\n\n### 1. Static Analysis Test (Jest/Vitest)\n```typescript\n// tests/color-consistency.test.ts\nimport { glob } from 'glob';\nimport { readFileSync } from 'fs';\n\ndescribe('Color Palette Consistency', () => {\n  const componentFiles = glob.sync('apps/web/src/components/**/*.tsx');\n  const pageFiles = glob.sync('apps/web/src/app/**/*.tsx');\n  const allFiles = [...componentFiles, ...pageFiles];\n\n  // Files explicitly allowed to use zinc (none expected after migration)\n  const zincAllowlist: string[] = [];\n  \n  // Files allowed to use indigo (Pro features, semantic search indicator)\n  const indigoAllowlist = [\n    'SpotlightSearch.tsx', // Semantic toggle only - amber/indigo intentional\n  ];\n\n  describe('No zinc-* colors in components', () => {\n    test.each(allFiles)('%s should not contain zinc-*', (filePath) => {\n      if (zincAllowlist.some(allowed => filePath.includes(allowed))) {\n        console.log(\\`[SKIP] \\${filePath} is in allowlist\\`);\n        return;\n      }\n      \n      const content = readFileSync(filePath, 'utf-8');\n      const zincMatches = content.match(/zinc-\\d+/g) || [];\n      \n      if (zincMatches.length > 0) {\n        console.log(\\`[FAIL] \\${filePath}:\\`);\n        console.log(\\`  Found zinc colors: \\${[...new Set(zincMatches)].join(', ')}\\`);\n        console.log(\\`  Lines:\\`);\n        content.split('\\\\n').forEach((line, idx) => {\n          if (line.includes('zinc-')) {\n            console.log(\\`    \\${idx + 1}: \\${line.trim().slice(0, 80)}\\`);\n          }\n        });\n        console.log(\\`  Fix: Replace zinc-* with neutral-*\\`);\n      } else {\n        console.log(\\`[PASS] \\${filePath} - no zinc colors\\`);\n      }\n      \n      expect(zincMatches).toHaveLength(0);\n    });\n  });\n\n  describe('Indigo-* only in allowed files', () => {\n    test.each(allFiles)('%s indigo usage is intentional', (filePath) => {\n      const content = readFileSync(filePath, 'utf-8');\n      const indigoMatches = content.match(/indigo-\\d+/g) || [];\n      \n      if (indigoMatches.length === 0) {\n        console.log(\\`[PASS] \\${filePath} - no indigo colors\\`);\n        return;\n      }\n      \n      const isAllowed = indigoAllowlist.some(allowed => filePath.includes(allowed));\n      \n      if (!isAllowed) {\n        console.log(\\`[FAIL] \\${filePath}:\\`);\n        console.log(\\`  Found indigo colors: \\${[...new Set(indigoMatches)].join(', ')}\\`);\n        console.log(\\`  This file is not in the indigo allowlist.\\`);\n        console.log(\\`  If intentional, add to indigoAllowlist.

Apply search query → chip appears with query text\n2. Apply category → chip appears with category name\n3. Apply multiple tags → multiple tag chips appear\n4. Click X on chip → that filter removed, results update\n5. Click \"Clear all\" → all filters removed\n6. Keyboard: Tab through chips, Enter to remove\n7.
