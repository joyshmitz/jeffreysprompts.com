{"id":"jeffreysprompts.com-4q8k","title":"EPIC: CLI Authentication \u0026 Premium Integration","description":"## Overview\nAdd optional authentication to the `jfp` CLI tool, allowing users to seamlessly access their premium account data including custom prompts, collections, saved/bookmarked prompts, and notes.\n\n## Why This Matters\nThe CLI is the primary interface for power users and AI agents. By adding authentication:\n- Premium users get their full library in the CLI\n- Users can access their collections and saved prompts\n- The \"swap meet\" community prompts become available\n- Notes and annotations sync across devices\n- Search spans all content (public + personal)\n\n## Design Principles\n\n### 1. Transparent for Non-Users\n- All existing functionality works WITHOUT login\n- No nag screens, no forced auth, no degraded experience\n- Login is purely additive - it unlocks MORE, never restricts\n- Clear, honest messaging about what premium provides\n\n### 2. Works Everywhere\n- Local machines: Browser-based OAuth with auto-callback\n- Remote/SSH: Device code flow (6-character code)\n- Headless servers: Same device code flow\n- CI/CD: Token-based auth via environment variable\n\n### 3. Secure \u0026 Private\n- Tokens stored securely in user's config directory\n- Short-lived access tokens with refresh capability\n- No passwords stored locally\n- Easy revocation via web dashboard\n\n## Authentication Flows\n\n### Flow 1: Local Machine (Default)\n```\nUser runs: jfp login\n    ↓\nCLI starts local HTTP server on random port (e.g., 19847)\n    ↓\nCLI opens browser to: https://premium.jeffreysprompts.com/cli/auth?port=19847\n    ↓\nUser completes Google OAuth on premium site\n    ↓\nPremium site redirects to: http://localhost:19847/callback?token=xxx\n    ↓\nCLI receives token, stores it, shows success message\n    ↓\nLocal server shuts down\n```\n\n### Flow 2: Remote Machine (--remote or auto-detected)\n```\nUser runs: jfp login --remote  (or CLI detects no display)\n    ↓\nCLI requests device code from: POST /api/cli/device-code\n    ↓\nAPI returns: { device_code: \"abc123\", user_code: \"XYZW-1234\", verification_url: \"...\" }\n    ↓\nCLI shows: \"Visit https://premium.jeffreysprompts.com/cli/verify and enter code: XYZW-1234\"\n    ↓\nUser visits URL, logs in with Google, enters code\n    ↓\nMeanwhile, CLI polls: POST /api/cli/device-token with device_code\n    ↓\nOnce user completes, API returns access token\n    ↓\nCLI stores token, shows success\n```\n\n### Flow 3: CI/CD / Programmatic\n```\nUser sets: JFP_TOKEN=xxx in environment\n    ↓\nCLI detects env var, uses it for all authenticated requests\n    ↓\nNo interactive login needed\n```\n\n## New CLI Commands\n\n### `jfp login`\n- Initiates authentication flow\n- Options: `--remote` (force device code flow)\n- Stores credentials in `~/.config/jfp/credentials.json`\n\n### `jfp logout`\n- Clears stored credentials\n- Optionally revokes token on server\n\n### `jfp whoami`\n- Shows current authentication status\n- Displays: email, tier, token expiry\n\n### `jfp list --mine`\n- Lists only user's custom prompts\n\n### `jfp list --saved`\n- Lists user's bookmarked/saved prompts\n\n### `jfp collections`\n- Lists user's collections\n- `jfp collections \u003cname\u003e` shows prompts in collection\n\n### `jfp notes \u003cprompt-id\u003e`\n- Shows notes for a prompt\n- `jfp notes \u003cprompt-id\u003e --add \"note text\"` adds a note\n\n## API Endpoints Needed (Premium Site)\n\n### Auth Endpoints\n- `POST /api/cli/device-code` - Initiate device code flow\n- `POST /api/cli/device-token` - Exchange device code for token\n- `POST /api/cli/token/refresh` - Refresh access token\n- `POST /api/cli/token/revoke` - Revoke token (logout)\n\n### Data Endpoints (Authenticated)\n- `GET /api/cli/me` - Current user info\n- `GET /api/cli/prompts` - All prompts (public + user's)\n- `GET /api/cli/prompts/mine` - User's custom prompts only\n- `GET /api/cli/prompts/saved` - User's saved/bookmarked prompts\n- `GET /api/cli/collections` - User's collections\n- `GET /api/cli/collections/:id` - Collection details with prompts\n- `GET /api/cli/notes/:promptId` - Notes for a prompt\n- `POST /api/cli/notes/:promptId` - Add note to prompt\n\n## Token Format\nUsing JWT with claims:\n- `sub`: User ID\n- `email`: User email\n- `tier`: Subscription tier (free/premium)\n- `exp`: Expiration time\n- `iat`: Issued at time\n\n## Credential Storage\nLocation: `~/.config/jfp/credentials.json`\n```json\n{\n  \"access_token\": \"eyJ...\",\n  \"refresh_token\": \"xxx\",\n  \"expires_at\": \"2024-01-15T10:30:00Z\",\n  \"email\": \"user@example.com\",\n  \"tier\": \"premium\"\n}\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n- `jfp login` works on local machines with browser\n- `jfp login --remote` works on headless/SSH machines\n- Authenticated users see their prompts in `jfp list`\n- `jfp search` finds results in personal prompts\n- Token refresh happens automatically\n- Logout clears all credentials\n- Non-authenticated users have identical experience to before","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-10T20:08:45.460885074-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-10T20:08:45.460885074-05:00"}

The device code flow:\n1. User runs `jfp login --remote` on server\n2. CLI shows a URL and 6-character code\n3. User visits URL on ANY device (phone, laptop, etc.)\n4. User enters code after authenticating\n5. CLI receives token via polling\n\nThis is the same pattern used by:\n- GitHub CLI (`gh auth login`)\n- Azure CLI (`az login`)\n- AWS SSO (`aws sso login`)\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Add to `packages/cli/src/commands/login.ts`\n\n```typescript\nconst POLL_INTERVAL = 2_000;  // Poll every 2 seconds\nconst MAX_POLL_ATTEMPTS = 60;  // 2 minutes max\n\ninterface DeviceCodeResponse {\n  device_code: string;      // Internal code for polling\n  user_code: string;        // Code user enters (e.g., \"XYZW-1234\")\n  verification_url: string; // URL to visit\n  expires_in: number;       // Seconds until expiry\n  interval: number;         // Recommended poll interval\n}\n\ninterface DeviceTokenResponse {\n  access_token: string;\n  refresh_token?: string;\n  expires_at: string;\n  email: string;\n  tier: \"free\" | \"premium\";\n  user_id: string;\n}\n\ninterface DeviceTokenError {\n  error: string;\n  error_description?: string;\n}\n\nasync function loginRemote(options: LoginOptions): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n  console.log(chalk.dim(\"Initiating device code authentication...\\n\"));\n  \n  // Request device code from API\n  const deviceCodeResponse = await fetch(`${PREMIUM_URL}/api/cli/device-code`, {\n    method: \"POST\",\n    headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n    body: JSON.stringify({ client_id: \"jfp-cli\" }),\n  });\n  \n  if (!deviceCodeResponse.ok) {\n    console.log(chalk.red(\"Failed to initiate authentication\"));\n    process.exit(1);\n  }\n  \n  const { device_code, user_code, verification_url, interval } = \n    await deviceCodeResponse.json() as DeviceCodeResponse;\n  \n  // Display instructions to user\n  console.log(boxen(\n    `To sign in, visit:\\n\\n` +\n    `  ${chalk.cyan(verification_url)}\\n\\n` +\n    `And enter code:\\n\\n` +\n    `  ${chalk.bold.yellow(formatUserCode(user_code))}`,\n    { \n      padding: 1, \n      margin: 1, \n      borderStyle: \"round\",\n      title: \"Device Authentication\",\n      titleAlignment: \"center\",\n    }\n  ));\n  \n  console.log(chalk.dim(\"\\nWaiting for authentication...\"));\n  console.log(chalk.dim(\"(Press Ctrl+C to cancel)\\n\"));\n  \n  // Poll for token\n  const pollInterval = Math.max(interval * 1000, POLL_INTERVAL);\n  let attempts = 0;\n  \n  while (attempts \u003c MAX_POLL_ATTEMPTS) {\n    await sleep(pollInterval);\n    attempts++;\n    \n    try {\n      const tokenResponse = await fetch(`${PREMIUM_URL}/api/cli/device-token`, {\n        method: \"POST\",\n        headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n        body: JSON.stringify({ \n          device_code,\n          client_id: \"jfp-cli\",\n        }),\n      });\n      \n      if (tokenResponse.ok) {\n        const credentials = await tokenResponse.json() as DeviceTokenResponse;\n        \n        // Save credentials\n        await saveCredentials({\n          access_token: credentials.access_token,\n          refresh_token: credentials.refresh_token,\n          expires_at: credentials.expires_at,\n          email: credentials.email,\n          tier: credentials.tier,\n          user_id: credentials.user_id,\n        });\n        \n        console.log(boxen(\n          `${chalk.green(\"✓\")} Logged in as ${chalk.bold(credentials.email)}\\n` +\n          `Tier: ${chalk.cyan(credentials.tier)}`,\n          { padding: 1, margin: 1, borderStyle: \"round\", borderColor: \"green\" }\n        ));\n        \n        return;\n      }\n      \n      // Check for specific errors\n      const errorBody = await tokenResponse.json() as DeviceTokenError;\n      \n      if (errorBody.error === \"authorization_pending\") {\n        // User hasn't completed auth yet, keep polling\n        process.stdout.write(\".\");\n        continue;\n      }\n      \n      if (errorBody.error === \"slow_down\") {\n        // API wants us to slow down\n        await sleep(5000);\n        continue;\n      }\n      \n      if (errorBody.error === \"expired_token\") {\n        console.log(chalk.red(\"\\n\\nDevice code expired.

Users should easily find:\n- **Go Pro** (primary CTA)\n- **Login** (secondary link for existing Pro users)\n\n## Primary Placement\n- **Component:** `apps/web/src/components/Nav.tsx`\n- **Entry point:** `apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx` renders `\u003cNav /\u003e`\n\n## UX \u0026 Visual Requirements\n- **Free-first:** CTA should be visible but not dominant.\n- **Desktop:**\n  - Secondary text link: **Login**\n  - Primary button-like link: **Go Pro** (or **Upgrade** if copy fits better)\n- **Mobile:**\n  - Add both links to the mobile sheet/menu.\n  - **Go Pro** must be visually stronger than **Login**.\n- **Don’t break layout:** no wrapping or overflow at common widths.\n\n## URL \u0026 Routing\n- Base URL: `https://pro.jeffreysprompts.com`\n- CTA: `${PRO_URL}/` (Go Pro)\n- Login: `${PRO_URL}/login`\n\n## Implementation Details\n1) **Add a public env var**\n   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRO_URL` with default fallback to `https://pro.jeffreysprompts.com`.\n   - Update `apps/web/src/lib/env.ts` (or relevant env schema) to include it.\n\n2) **Centralize URL usage**\n   - In `Nav.tsx`, define:\n     ```ts\n     const PRO_URL = env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PRO_URL ?? \"https://pro.jeffreysprompts.com\";\n     const proHref = `${PRO_URL}/`;\n     const loginHref = `${PRO_URL}/login`;\n     ```\n\n3) **Styling**\n   - Use existing button/link styles in the nav to match the design system.\n   - Prefer shadcn `Button` or existing Tailwind utility classes used in `Nav.tsx`.\n\n## Analytics (Optional but Preferred)\nIf analytics helper exists (e.g., `apps/web/src/lib/analytics.ts`), add events:\n- `pro_cta_clicked` (button)\n- `pro_login_clicked` (link)\nAttach context: `{ placement: \"nav\", device: \"desktop|mobile\" }` if available.\n\n## Edge Cases\n- If `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRO_URL` is missing, default to hardcoded `https://pro.jeffreysprompts.com`.\n- Ensure external link safety if using `target=\"_blank\"`: include `rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"`.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Desktop and mobile nav both show **Go Pro** and **Login**.\n- Both links route to Pro site endpoints above.\n- Styles match the current nav and preserve free-first tone.\n- No layout regression on small screens.\n- (Optional) Analytics events fire on click.\n","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-10T20:12:19.562656095-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-10T20:20:02.180861176-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-10T20:15:57.113388858-05:00","close_reason":"Added Pro CTA and Login links to Nav: desktop shows Login (secondary) and Go Pro button (primary with Crown icon) before basket; mobile menu shows same links in a separated section.
