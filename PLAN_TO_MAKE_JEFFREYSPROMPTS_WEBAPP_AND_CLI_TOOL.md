# PLAN: JeffreysPrompts.com — Ultra-Detailed Implementation Blueprint

---

## Background Context

This section provides all the context needed to understand this project from first principles. It is designed to make this plan completely self-contained so that any developer or AI agent can pick it up and execute without additional context.

### Origin Story: "My Favorite Prompts" Twitter Series

In early January 2025, Jeffrey Emanuel ([@doodlestein](https://twitter.com/doodlestein)) began posting a series of tweets titled **"My Favorite Prompts"** — a curated collection of his most effective prompts for working with AI coding agents like Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI.

These prompts are battle-tested patterns that Jeffrey has refined through extensive real-world usage. They represent distilled wisdom about how to get the most out of agentic coding tools.

#### The First Three Prompts

**Prompt 1: The Idea Wizard**
> "Come up with your very best ideas for improving this project to make it more robust, reliable, performant, intuitive, user-friendly, ergonomic, useful, compelling, etc. while still being obviously accretive and pragmatic. Come up with 30 ideas and then really think through each idea carefully, how it would work, how users are likely to perceive it, how we would implement it, etc; then winnow that list down to your VERY best 5 ideas. Explain each of the 5 ideas in order from best to worst and give your full, detailed rationale and justification for how and why it would make the project obviously better and why you're confident of that assessment. Use ultrathink."

This prompt is designed to generate a high-quality, rigorously evaluated set of improvement ideas. The key insight is the "30 → 5" funnel: by forcing the agent to generate many ideas and then critically evaluate them, you get much better results than asking for "5 good ideas" directly.

**Prompt 2: The README Reviser**
> "OK, we have made tons of recent changes that aren't yet reflected in the README file. First, reread AGENTS.md so it's still fresh in your mind. Use ultrathink. Now, we need to revise the README for these changes (don't write about them as 'changes' however, make it read like it was always like that, since we don't have any users yet!). Also, what else can we put in there to make the README longer and more detailed about what we built, why it's useful, how it works, the algorithms/design principles used, etc? This should be incremental NEW content, not replacement for what is there already. And generally, look for any chunks of important features/functionality that are currently fully implemented in the code, but unmentioned, under-documented, under-explained, or under-justified in the README file."

This prompt addresses a common problem: documentation drift. The key insight is framing updates as "how it always was" rather than "what changed," which produces cleaner, more professional documentation.

**Prompt 3: The Robot-Mode Maker**
> "Next, I want you to create a 'robot mode' for coding agents that want to interact with this so they don't need to use the UI but can instead access all the same functionality via a CLI in the console that is hyper-optimized and ergonomic for agents, while also being ultra-intuitive for coding agents like yourself; the agent users should get back as output either JSON or markdown—whatever fits best in the context and is most token-efficient and intuitive for you. Basically, the agent users should get all the same information as a human would get from manipulating and visually observing the UI, but in a more usable, helpful, intuitive, and accessible form for agents. Make the tooling here that YOU would want if YOU were using it (because you WILL be!), that maximizes agent ergonomics and agent intuition. Be sure to give the command a quick-start mode (when no arguments are supplied) that explains the most critical functionality in the most intuitive, token-dense way possible. Use ultrathink."

This prompt creates agent-friendly CLI interfaces. The key insight is asking the agent to build what *it* would want to use, which produces genuinely ergonomic tooling.

#### The "ultrathink" Pattern

Several of Jeffrey's prompts include "Use ultrathink." This is a meta-prompt that triggers extended thinking/reasoning in Claude models. It signals that the task warrants deep analysis rather than quick responses.

### Community Response and Domain Purchase

The prompts resonated strongly with the AI/developer community on Twitter. A notable interaction occurred:

> **@NoahGreenSnow**: "Question Jeffrey, when do we get the slick JeffreysPrompts.com? I noticed in the agentic flywheel site you had a section with a collection of your prompts in the advanced workflows. I think this would be a beautiful standalone project."

> **@doodlestein**: "'Where'd you get that prompt?! It's lovely!' 'Oh, this old thing? I got it at JeffreysPrompts.com.' lol"

This exchange, initially a joke, led Jeffrey to actually purchase **jeffreysprompts.com** through Cloudflare. The domain is registered and ready for deployment.

### What This Project Is

JeffreysPrompts.com is a platform for showcasing, distributing, and using Jeffrey's curated prompts. It has three components:

1. **Web Application**: A beautiful, fast, single-page site where users can:
   - Browse all prompts with search and filtering
   - Copy prompts to clipboard with one click
   - Add prompts to a "basket" for bulk download
   - Export prompts as markdown or Claude Code skills
   - Install prompts directly as Claude Code skills

2. **CLI Tool (`jfp`)**: A command-line tool for power users and agents that provides:
   - Fuzzy search with fzf-style interactive mode
   - JSON output for programmatic access
   - Direct installation of prompts as Claude Code skills
   - Quick-start mode optimized for agent discoverability

3. **Claude Code Skills Integration**: First-class support for Claude Code's skills system, allowing prompts to be installed as reusable skills that Claude can invoke automatically.

### The Model Project: brennerbot.org

This project uses **brennerbot.org** as its architectural and design template. BrennerBot is Jeffrey's existing production web application, a sophisticated research platform built with:

- **Next.js 16** (App Router) + **React 19** (Server Components)
- **Tailwind CSS 4** with custom design tokens
- **Bun** as the sole JavaScript runtime and package manager
- **Vercel** for deployment
- **shadcn/ui** for accessible component primitives
- **Framer Motion** for animations

BrennerBot has several features that directly inspire JeffreysPrompts:

| BrennerBot Feature | JeffreysPrompts Equivalent |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Quote Bank (curated quotes with tags, search, copy) | Prompt Registry (curated prompts with tags, search, copy) |
| Jargon System (hover tooltips, bottom sheets) | Prompt Detail (preview, full view) |
| Spotlight Search (Cmd+K command palette) | Spotlight Search (same pattern) |
| Copy Button (animated feedback, toast) | Copy Button (identical component) |
| brenner CLI (Bun single-file binary) | jfp CLI (same architecture) |

The brennerbot.org codebase is located at `/data/projects/brenner_bot/` and contains:
- 522 TypeScript/TSX files
- 80%+ test coverage
- 3,531 lines of CSS with 70+ animations
- A 9,000+ line CLI tool compiled to a single binary
- Comprehensive accessibility and mobile optimization

### What Are Claude Code Skills?

Claude Code skills are a feature of [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. Skills allow users to teach Claude reusable procedures, workflows, and domain knowledge.

#### Skills Architecture

A skill is a folder containing a `SKILL.md` file:

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md        # Required: YAML frontmatter + instructions
├── scripts/        # Optional: Executable scripts Claude can run
├── references/     # Optional: Reference documents loaded on-demand
└── assets/         # Optional: Images, data, templates
```

The `SKILL.md` file has this structure:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: What this skill does and when to use it
---

# Skill Title

[Instructions that Claude follows when the skill is active]

## When to Use
- Scenario 1
- Scenario 2

## Guidelines
- Guideline 1
- Guideline 2
```

#### Progressive Disclosure

Skills use a three-tier loading system to minimize context usage:

1. **Startup**: Claude loads only `name` + `description` for all installed skills
2. **Invocation**: When a skill is relevant, Claude loads the full `SKILL.md`
3. **Deep Dive**: Additional files (`references/`, `scripts/`) are loaded only when needed

This design allows skills to bundle unlimited context without bloating the initial prompt.

#### Skill Locations

- **Personal Skills**: `~/.config/claude/skills/` — Available in all projects
- **Project Skills**: `.claude/skills/` — Shared via git with team members

#### Why Skills Matter for JeffreysPrompts

By exporting prompts as Claude Code skills, users can:
- Invoke prompts by name without copy-pasting
- Have Claude automatically suggest relevant prompts
- Share prompt collections with teams via git
- Update all installed prompts with a single command

This transforms prompts from passive text snippets into active, integrated tools.

### Target Audiences

#### 1. Human Developers (Web App Focus)

Developers who want to:
- Discover new prompts for common tasks
- Quickly copy prompts for immediate use
- Build a personal collection of favorites
- Learn prompt engineering patterns from examples

The web app prioritizes:
- Beautiful, scannable UI
- One-click copy with visual feedback
- Mobile-responsive design
- Fast search and filtering

#### 2. AI Coding Agents (CLI Focus)

Agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI) that want to:
- Programmatically access prompt content
- Install prompts as skills for future use
- Search for relevant prompts given a task
- Parse structured prompt metadata

The CLI prioritizes:
- JSON output mode for parsing
- Token-efficient responses
- Quick-start help for discoverability
- Non-interactive batch operations

#### 3. Power Users (Both)

Developers who use both the web app and CLI:
- Browse visually, copy via CLI
- Install skills from CLI, verify on web
- Use interactive fzf-style mode for exploration

### Design Philosophy

#### 1. TypeScript-Native Data

Prompts are defined as TypeScript objects, not markdown files:

```typescript
// apps/web/src/lib/prompts/registry.ts
export const prompts: Prompt[] = [
  {
    id: "idea-wizard",
    title: "The Idea Wizard",
    description: "Generate and evaluate 30 ideas, distill to best 5",
    category: "ideation",
    tags: ["brainstorming", "improvement", "ultrathink"],
    content: `Come up with your very best ideas...`,
    // ...
  },
];
```

Benefits:
- **Type safety**: TypeScript catches missing fields, typos
- **IDE support**: Autocomplete for categories, tags
- **No parsing**: No gray-matter, no markdown AST, no regex
- **Single source of truth**: The data IS the code

#### 2. Agent-First Design

Every feature considers the agent user:
- CLI has `--json` flag for every command
- Quick-start mode is token-dense and informative
- Output formats are predictable and parseable
- Installation is automatable (no interactive prompts required)

#### 3. Copy Is King

The primary action is copying prompts. Every UI decision supports this:
- Copy button is prominent on every card
- Success feedback is immediate and satisfying
- Clipboard includes full prompt text
- Bulk export for collections

#### 4. Skills Are First-Class

Claude Code skills are not an afterthought:
- One-click install from web UI
- CLI `install` command with `--all` flag
- Bulk install via `curl | bash`
- Update mechanism for keeping skills current

#### 5. Mobile Excellence

Following brennerbot.org patterns:
- Touch targets are 44px minimum
- Bottom sheet for mobile interactions
- No horizontal scroll
- iOS Safari visual viewport fixes

### Technical Decisions

#### Bun-Only

- **Runtime**: Bun, not Node.js
- **Package manager**: Bun (`bun install`), not npm/yarn/pnpm
- **Lockfile**: `bun.lock` only
- **CLI compilation**: `bun build --compile` for single-file binaries

#### Next.js 16 + React 19

- **App Router**: File-based routing in `app/` directory
- **Server Components**: Default for pages, Client Components for interactivity
- **Streaming**: React Suspense for loading states

#### Tailwind CSS 4

- **CSS Variables**: Native custom properties, no JavaScript theme
- **OKLCH Colors**: Perceptually uniform color space
- **Fluid Typography**: `clamp()` for responsive sizing

#### Vercel Deployment

- **Root Directory**: `apps/web` (monorepo structure)
- **Build Command**: `bun run build`
- **No Edge Functions**: Simple static + serverless

#### Cloudflare DNS

- **Domain**: jeffreysprompts.com registered on Cloudflare
- **DNS**: CNAME to `cname.vercel-dns.com`
- **Wrangler**: CLI for DNS management

### Relationship to AGENTS.md

Every project in Jeffrey's ecosystem has an `AGENTS.md` file that defines rules for AI agents working on the codebase. This project's `AGENTS.md` (already created) includes:

1. **Rule 1 (Absolute)**: Never delete files without explicit permission
2. **Bun-only toolchain**: No npm, yarn, pnpm
3. **Vercel deployment safety**: Never modify vercel.json without approval
4. **Landing the plane**: Always push before ending a session

The AGENTS.md for this project is adapted from brennerbot.org but customized for the simpler scope of JeffreysPrompts.

### What Success Looks Like

#### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

1. **Web App**:
   - Home page with hero, search, category filters, prompt grid
   - PromptCard with title, description, tags, copy button, basket add

Also, what else can we put in there to make the README longer and more detailed about what we built, why it's useful, how it works, the algorithms/design principles used, etc? This should be incremental NEW content, not replacement for what is there already.

The agent users should get back as output either JSON or markdown—whatever fits best in the context and is most token-efficient and intuitive for you.

Basically, the agent users should get all the same information as a human would get from manipulating and visually observing the UI, but in a more usable, helpful, intuitive, and accessible form for agents.

Make the tooling here that YOU would want if YOU were using it (because you WILL be!), that maximizes agent ergonomics and agent intuition.

Be sure to give the command a quick-start mode (when no arguments are supplied) that explains the most critical functionality in the most intuitive, token-dense way possible.

### 2.3 Adding New Prompts (Developer Workflow)

Jeffrey adds new prompts by editing `apps/web/src/lib/prompts/registry.ts`:

```typescript
// Just add a new entry to the prompts array:
{
  id: "new-prompt-slug",
  title: "The New Prompt",
  description: "One-line description",
  category: "ideation",
  tags: ["tag1", "tag2"],
  author: "Jeffrey Emanuel",
  twitter: "@doodlestein",
  version: "1.0.0",
  created: "2026-01-09",  // Use today's date in ISO format
  content: `Full prompt content here...`,
},
```

Benefits:
- **Type-safe**: TypeScript catches typos and missing fields
- **IDE support**: Autocomplete for categories, tags, etc.
- **No parsing**: No gray-matter, no markdown AST, no regex
- **Instant**: No build step to convert markdown to JSON
- **Native**: The data IS the code

## Part 3: Claude Code Skills Integration

### 3.1 Understanding Claude Code Skills

Skills are folders containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter:

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md        # Required: Instructions with YAML frontmatter
├── scripts/        # Optional: Executable scripts
├── references/     # Optional: Reference documents
└── assets/         # Optional: Images, data files
```

**SKILL.md format:**

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Clear description of what this skill does and when to use it
---

# Skill Title

[Instructions that Claude follows when the skill is active]

## When to Use
- Scenario 1
- Scenario 2

## Guidelines
- Guideline 1
- Guideline 2
```

**Skill locations:**
- **Personal skills**: `~/.config/claude/skills/` (available everywhere)
- **Project skills**: `.claude/skills/` (shared with team via git)

**Progressive disclosure:**
1. At startup, Claude loads only `name` + `description` into context
2. When a skill is invoked, Claude reads the full `SKILL.md`
3. Additional files (`references/`, `scripts/`) are loaded on-demand

### 3.2 Skills Export System

```typescript
// apps/web/src/lib/export/skills.ts

import { type Prompt } from "../prompts/types";
import JSZip from "jszip";

/**
 * Generate SKILL.md content for a single prompt.
 */
export function generateSkillMd(prompt: Prompt): string {
  const whenToUse = prompt.whenToUse?.length
    ? `\n## When to Use\n\n${prompt.whenToUse.map((w) => `- ${w}`).join("\n")}`
    : "";

  const tips = prompt.tips?.length
    ? `\n\n## Tips\n\n${prompt.tips.map((t) => `- ${t}`).join("\n")}`
    : "";

  const examples = prompt.examples?.length
    ? `\n\n## Examples\n\n${prompt.examples.map((e) => `- ${e}`).join("\n")}`
    : "";

  return `---

`;
}

/**
 * Generate a zip file containing multiple skills.
 */
export async function generateSkillsZip(prompts: Prompt[]): Promise<Blob> {
  const zip = new JSZip();

  for (const prompt of prompts) {
    const skillMd = generateSkillMd(prompt);
    zip.file(`${prompt.id}/SKILL.md`, skillMd);
  }

  // Add README explaining the bundle
  zip.file("README.md", `# Jeffrey's Prompts Skills Bundle

This bundle contains ${prompts.length} Claude Code skills from [JeffreysPrompts.com](https://jeffreysprompts.com).

 */
export function generateInstallScript(prompts: Prompt[], targetDir: string): string {
  const skillDirs = prompts.map((p) => {
    // Using a quoted HEREDOC delimiter ('SKILL_EOF') prevents variable expansion,
    // so single quotes in the content don't need escaping
    const skillContent = generateSkillMd(p);
    return `
# ${p.title}
mkdir -p "${targetDir}/${p.id}"
cat > "${targetDir}/${p.id}/SKILL.md" << 'SKILL_EOF'

}
```

### 3.2.4 Markdown Export

For users who want plain markdown without the Claude Code skill structure:

```typescript
// apps/web/src/lib/export/markdown.ts

import { type Prompt } from "@/lib/prompts/types";

/**
 * Generate markdown for a single prompt.
 */
export function generatePromptMarkdown(prompt: Prompt): string {
  const tags = prompt.tags.map((t) => `\`${t}\``).join(", ");

  return `# ${prompt.title}

**Category:** ${prompt.category}
**Tags:** ${tags}
**Author:** ${prompt.author}

---

${prompt.content}

---

*From [JeffreysPrompts.com](https://jeffreysprompts.com/prompts/${prompt.id})*
`;
}

/**
 * Generate a combined markdown document for multiple prompts.
 */
export function generateBundleMarkdown(prompts: Prompt[]): string {
  const toc = prompts.map((p, i) => `${i + 1}. [${p.title}](#${p.id})`).join("\n");

  const content = prompts.map((p) => `
<a id="${p.id}"></a>

## ${p.title}

**Category:** ${p.category} | **Tags:** ${p.tags.join(", ")}

${p.content}

---
`).join("\n");

  return `# Jeffrey's Prompts Collection

${content}

---

*Exported from [JeffreysPrompts.com](https://jeffreysprompts.com) on ${new Date().toISOString().split("T")[0]}*
`;
}
```

### 3.2.5 Search Engine

The search engine powers both the web app's SpotlightSearch and the CLI's fuzzy search. It uses MiniSearch for fast, typo-tolerant full-text search.

```typescript
// apps/web/src/lib/search/engine.ts

import MiniSearch from "minisearch";
import { prompts } from "@/lib/prompts/registry";
import { type Prompt } from "@/lib/prompts/types";

// ============================================================================

  category: string;
  tags: string[];
  content: string;
  score: number;
}

// ============================================================================
// Search Index (lazy initialization)
// ============================================================================

let searchIndex: MiniSearch<Prompt> | null = null;

function getSearchIndex(): MiniSearch<Prompt> {
  if (!searchIndex) {
    searchIndex = new MiniSearch<Prompt>({
      fields: ["title", "description", "content", "tags"],
      storeFields: ["id", "title", "description", "category", "tags", "content"],
      searchOptions: {
        boost: { title: 3, description: 2, tags: 1.5, content: 1 },
        fuzzy: 0.2,
        prefix: true,
      },
    });

    searchIndex.addAll(prompts);
  }

  return searchIndex;
}

// ============================================================================
// Search Functions
// ============================================================================

/**
 * Search prompts with fuzzy matching.
 * Returns results sorted by relevance score.
 */
export function searchPrompts(query: string, limit = 20): SearchResult[] {
  if (!query.trim()) {
    return [];
  }

  const index = getSearchIndex();
  const results = index.search(query, { limit });

  return results.map((result) => ({
    id: result.id,
    title: result.title,
    description: result.description,
    category: result.category,
    tags: result.tags,
    content: result.content,
    score: result.score,
  }));
}

/**
 * Get search suggestions (autocomplete).
 */
export function getSuggestions(query: string, limit = 5): string[] {
  if (!query.trim()) {
    return [];
  }

  const index = getSearchIndex();
  return index.autoSuggest(query, { limit }).map((s) => s.suggestion);
}

/**
 * Filter prompts by category.
 */
export function filterByCategory(category: string): Prompt[] {
  return prompts.filter((p) => p.category === category);
}

/**
 * Filter prompts by tag.
 */
export function filterByTag(tag: string): Prompt[] {
  return prompts.filter((p) => p.tags.includes(tag));
}

/**
 * Combined search + filter.
 */
export function searchAndFilter(
  query: string,
  options: { category?: string; tags?: string[] } = {}
): SearchResult[] {
  let results = query.trim() ? searchPrompts(query) : prompts.map((p) => ({
    ...p,
    score: 1,
  }));

  if (options.category) {
    results = results.filter((r) => r.category === options.category);
  }

  if (options.tags?.length) {
    results = results.filter((r) =>
      options.tags!.some((tag) => r.tags.includes(tag))
    );
  }

  return results;
}
```

**API endpoint for prompts (JSON):**

```typescript
// apps/web/src/app/api/prompts/route.ts

```

**API endpoint for single skill (SKILL.md):**

```typescript

```

**API endpoint for embeddings (semantic search):**

```typescript

```

**API endpoint for install script:**

```typescript
// apps/web/src/app/install.sh/route.ts

import { prompts } from "@/lib/prompts/registry";
import { generateInstallScript } from "@/lib/export/skills";

export async function GET() {
  const script = generateInstallScript(prompts, "~/.config/claude/skills");

```

**CLI binary release strategy:**

CLI binaries are distributed via GitHub Releases. The build process creates binaries for:
- `jfp-linux-x64` — Linux x86_64
- `jfp-linux-arm64` — Linux ARM64
- `jfp-darwin-x64` — macOS Intel
- `jfp-darwin-arm64` — macOS Apple Silicon
- `jfp-windows-x64.exe` — Windows x86_64

```bash
# Build script for releases (scripts/build-releases.sh)
#!/bin/bash
set -e

VERSION=${1:-"dev"}
OUTDIR="dist/releases"
mkdir -p "$OUTDIR"

# Build for each target
for target in bun-linux-x64 bun-linux-arm64 bun-darwin-x64 bun-darwin-arm64 bun-windows-x64; do
  platform=${target#bun-}
  outfile="$OUTDIR/jfp-$platform"
  [[ "$target" == *windows* ]] && outfile="$outfile.exe"

  echo "Building $outfile..."
  bun build --compile --target=$target ./jfp.ts --outfile "$outfile"
done

echo "Done! Binaries in $OUTDIR"
```

The `/releases/` URLs in the README point to GitHub Releases, not the web app itself.

## Part 4: Claude Skill for Formatting New Prompts

Create a skill that helps Jeffrey format new prompts:

### 4.1 The prompt-formatter Skill

```yaml
# .claude/skills/prompt-formatter/SKILL.md
---
name: prompt-formatter
description: Convert raw prompt text into the JeffreysPrompts.com TypeScript format with all required fields
---

# Prompt Formatter

You are helping Jeffrey Emanuel add a new prompt to JeffreysPrompts.com.

Given a raw prompt text and optional title, generate the complete TypeScript prompt entry for the registry.

## Input Format

The user will provide:
1. A title (or you'll suggest one)
2. The raw prompt text
3. Optionally, category and tags

## Output Format

Generate a TypeScript object that fits this interface:

```typescript
{
  id: string,           // kebab-case slug derived from title
  title: string,        // The title
  description: string,  // One-line summary (max 100 chars)
  category: PromptCategory,
  tags: string[],       // 3-5 relevant tags
  author: "Jeffrey Emanuel",
  twitter: "@doodlestein",
  version: "1.0.0",
  featured: boolean,    // true if this is a particularly good one
  difficulty: PromptDifficulty,
  estimatedTokens: number,
  created: string,      // Today's date in ISO format
  content: string,      // The prompt text (use backticks)
  whenToUse: string[],  // 3-4 scenarios
  tips: string[],       // 2-3 practical tips
}
```

## Categories

- "ideation" — Brainstorming, creativity, idea generation
- "documentation" — READMEs, docs, comments, explanations
- "automation" — Robot mode, CLI, agent optimization
- "refactoring" — Code improvement, cleanup, architecture
- "testing" — Test generation, coverage, quality
- "debugging" — Bug finding, fixing, analysis
- "workflow" — Process improvement, productivity
- "communication" — Writing, feedback, reviews

## Example

Input:
> Title: The Bug Hunter
> Prompt: Find all the bugs in this codebase. Look for edge cases, off-by-one errors, null pointer issues, race conditions, etc. For each bug found, explain the issue, its severity, and how to fix it.

Output:
```typescript
{
  id: "bug-hunter",
  title: "The Bug Hunter",
  description: "Systematically find bugs including edge cases, null pointers, and race conditions",
  category: "debugging",
  tags: ["bugs", "edge-cases", "code-review", "quality"],
  author: "Jeffrey Emanuel",
  twitter: "@doodlestein",
  version: "1.0.0",
  featured: false,
  difficulty: "intermediate",
  estimatedTokens: 200,
  created: "2025-01-09",
  content: `Find all the bugs in this codebase. Look for edge cases, off-by-one errors, null pointer issues, race conditions, etc. For each bug found, explain the issue, its severity, and how to fix it.`,
  whenToUse: [
    "Before deploying to production",
    "After major refactoring",
    "During code review",
    "When debugging mysterious failures",
  ],
  tips: [
    "Run on individual files for more focused analysis",
    "Combine with test generation for comprehensive coverage",
    "Prioritize fixes by severity",
  ],
},
```

## Guidelines

1. Always use backtick template literals for multi-line content
2. Keep description under 100 characters
3. Include 3-5 relevant, searchable tags
4. Estimate tokens based on prompt length (~1 token per 4 chars)
5. Set difficulty based on prompt complexity
6. When unsure about category, prefer "workflow" as a catch-all
```

### 4.2 The skill-maker Meta-Skill (Prompts → SKILL.md)

This is the **meta-skill** — a Claude Code skill that creates other Claude Code skills from prompts. It's beautifully recursive: using a skill to make skills.

**Why this exists:**
- The `prompt-formatter` skill (4.1) converts raw text → TypeScript registry entries
- The `skill-maker` skill converts prompts → Claude Code SKILL.md files
- It can bundle multiple related prompts into a single cohesive skill
- It handles all the SKILL.md formatting, "When to Use" generation, and structure

```yaml
# .claude/skills/skill-maker/SKILL.md
---
name: skill-maker
description: Generate Claude Code SKILL.md files from prompts. Can bundle multiple related prompts into a single skill.
---

# Skill Maker

You are creating Claude Code skills from prompts in the JeffreysPrompts.com registry.

## What You Do

1. Take one or more prompts (by ID or raw text)
2. Generate a properly formatted SKILL.md file
3. Optionally bundle multiple related prompts into one cohesive skill
4. Handle all the structure: frontmatter, sections, "When to Use", tips

## Single Prompt → Single Skill

When given a single prompt ID like `idea-wizard`:

1. Look up the prompt in the registry (`apps/web/src/lib/prompts/registry.ts`)
2. Generate a SKILL.md with:
   - Proper YAML frontmatter (name, description)
   - The prompt content as the main body
   - "When to Use" section from the prompt's `whenToUse` field
   - "Tips" section from the prompt's `tips` field
   - Attribution footer linking to jeffreysprompts.com

## Multiple Prompts → Bundle Skill

When given multiple prompt IDs like `idea-wizard readme-reviser robot-mode-maker`:

1. Look up all prompts in the registry
2. Analyze their common themes to generate a bundle name
3. Generate a SKILL.md that:
   - Has a cohesive name and description covering all included prompts
   - Includes all prompt contents, clearly separated
   - Combines "When to Use" scenarios from all prompts
   - Adds a "Included Prompts" section listing what's bundled

## Output Format

For single prompt `idea-wizard`:

```markdown
---
name: idea-wizard
description: Generate 30 improvement ideas, rigorously evaluate, distill to the best 5
---

# The Idea Wizard

Come up with your very best ideas for improving this project...

## When to Use

- When starting a new feature and want to brainstorm approaches
- When a project feels stale and needs fresh ideas
- When preparing for a planning session
- When you want to systematically evaluate improvements

## Tips

- Be specific about what aspects you want to improve
- Run multiple times for different focus areas
- Use the output as a starting point, not a final plan

For bundled prompts `idea-wizard readme-reviser robot-mode-maker --bundle jeffrey-meta-prompts`:

```markdown
---
name: jeffrey-meta-prompts
description: Jeffrey's three essential meta-prompts for ideation, documentation, and agent tooling
---

# Jeffrey's Meta-Prompts Bundle

This skill bundles three complementary prompts that work together to improve any project.

## Included Prompts

1. **The Idea Wizard** — Generate and evaluate improvement ideas
2. **The README Reviser** — Update documentation for undocumented features
3. **The Robot-Mode Maker** — Create agent-optimized CLI interfaces

---

## 1. The Idea Wizard

Come up with your very best ideas for improving this project to make it more robust, reliable, performant, intuitive, user-friendly, ergonomic, useful, compelling, etc. while still being obviously accretive and pragmatic. Come up with 30 ideas and then really think through each idea carefully...

---

## 2. The README Reviser

OK, we have made tons of recent changes that aren't yet reflected in the README file. First, reread AGENTS.md so it's still fresh in your mind. Use ultrathink...

---

## 3. The Robot-Mode Maker

Next, I want you to create a "robot mode" for coding agents that want to interact with this so they don't need to use the UI but can instead access all the same functionality via a CLI...

---

## When to Use This Bundle

- **Idea Wizard**: At project start or when feeling stuck
- **README Reviser**: After implementing new features
- **Robot-Mode Maker**: When building tools that agents will use

## Tips

- Use these in sequence: ideate → implement → document → agent-optimize
- The "ultrathink" directive in each prompt triggers extended reasoning
- All three prompts are designed to produce actionable, high-quality output

---

*From [JeffreysPrompts.com](https://jeffreysprompts.com) by Jeffrey Emanuel*
```

## CLI Integration

The jfp CLI uses this skill's logic:

```bash
# Single prompt → skill
jfp export idea-wizard --format skill

# Multiple prompts → bundled skill
jfp export idea-wizard readme-reviser robot-mode-maker --bundle jeffrey-meta-prompts

# Install bundle directly
jfp install idea-wizard readme-reviser robot-mode-maker --bundle jeffrey-meta-prompts
```

## Guidelines

1. **Name intelligently** — For bundles, derive a name from the common theme
2. **Keep frontmatter description under 120 chars** — Claude loads these at startup
3. **Preserve the "ultrathink" directive** — It's intentional and important
4. **Always include attribution** — Link back to jeffreysprompts.com
5. **Use horizontal rules** — Separate prompts in bundles with `---`
6. **Generate "When to Use"** — If the source prompt lacks it, generate scenarios based on content
```

## Part 6: CLI Tool (jfp) — Complete Implementation

### 6.0 Robot-Mode Design Philosophy

This section applies Jeffrey's **Robot-Mode Maker** prompt directly to the jfp CLI design. The question is: **What would *I* (Claude, a coding agent) want from this tool?**

> "Make the tooling here that YOU would want if YOU were using it (because you WILL be!), that maximizes agent ergonomics and agent intuition."

#### Core Principle: Agent-First, Human-Compatible

The jfp CLI is primarily designed for AI coding agents, with humans as a secondary audience. This inverts the typical CLI design priority.

**Agent needs:**
- Structured, parseable output (JSON)
- Predictable response format
- Minimal, token-efficient output
- Meaningful exit codes
- Actionable error messages with suggestions
- Non-interactive by default

**Human needs:**
- Beautiful, readable output
- Interactive exploration mode
- Colors and formatting
- Progress indicators

The solution: **Smart defaults with explicit overrides.**

#### Output Format Philosophy

**Rule 1: JSON for structured data, Markdown for narrative.**

| Command | Default Output | Why |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| `jfp list` | Compact table | Humans scanning a list |
| `jfp list --json` | JSON array | Agents parsing/filtering |
| `jfp show <id>` | Markdown | Humans reading content |
| `jfp show <id> --json` | JSON object | Agents extracting fields |
| `jfp search <q>` | Ranked list | Humans evaluating matches |
| `jfp search <q> --json` | JSON with scores | Agents processing results |

**Rule 2: Detect TTY and adjust defaults.**

```typescript
// If stdout is not a TTY (piped output), default to JSON
const isTTY = process.stdout.isTTY;
const defaultFormat = isTTY ? "human" : "json";

// If --json is explicit, always JSON
// If --human is explicit, always human-readable
// Otherwise, use defaultFormat
```

This means agents can do:
```bash
# Agent piping output — automatically gets JSON
results=$(jfp search "brainstorm")
echo $results | jq '.results[0].id'

# Human in terminal — gets pretty output
jfp search "brainstorm"
```

**Rule 3: Token efficiency is paramount.**

As an agent with context limits, every token matters. Output should be:
- Dense but readable
- No redundant information
- No chatty explanations
- No decorative elements in JSON mode

#### Quick-Start Mode: What I (Claude) Would Want

When I run `jfp` with no arguments, I need to instantly understand:
1. What this tool does (one sentence)
2. The 4-5 most useful commands
3. How to get JSON output
4. Where to learn more

**NOT:**
- Long paragraphs of explanation
- Every flag documented
- Version history
- Author credits

**The ideal quick-start output (~15 lines, ~100 tokens):**

```
jfp — Jeffrey's Prompts CLI

QUICK START:
  jfp list                    List all prompts
  jfp search "idea"           Fuzzy search
  jfp show idea-wizard        View full prompt
  jfp install idea-wizard     Install as Claude Code skill

ADD --json TO ANY COMMAND FOR MACHINE-READABLE OUTPUT

EXPLORE:
  jfp i                       Interactive browser (fzf-style)

MORE: jfp help | Docs: jeffreysprompts.com
```

That's it. Dense, actionable, complete.

#### Error Handling for Agents

Errors should be structured and actionable, not just strings.

**Bad (typical CLI):**
```
Error: prompt not found
```

**Good (agent-friendly):**
```json
{
  "error": "prompt_not_found",
  "message": "No prompt with id 'foo-bar'",
  "suggestions": ["foo-baz", "idea-wizard"],
  "exitCode": 1
}
```

**Exit codes:**
| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | Not found (prompt, skill) |
| 2 | Invalid arguments |
| 3 | Installation failed |
| 4 | Network error |
| 5 | Permission denied |

```typescript
// Error handling pattern
function handleError(error: JfpError, flags: Flags) {
  if (flags.json) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify({
      error: error.code,
      message: error.message,
      suggestions: error.suggestions ?? [],
      exitCode: error.exitCode,
    }));
  } else {
    console.error(chalk.red(`Error: ${error.message}`));
    if (error.suggestions?.length) {
      console.error(chalk.dim(`Did you mean: ${error.suggestions.join(", ")}?`));
    }
  }
  process.exit(error.exitCode);
}
```

#### Token-Efficient Output Examples

**`jfp list` (human mode):**
```
ID                CATEGORY       TAGS                        DESCRIPTION
idea-wizard       ideation       brainstorm,ultrathink       Generate 30 ideas, distill to best 5
readme-reviser    documentation  docs,ultrathink             Update README for undocumented features
robot-mode-maker  automation     cli,agent,ultrathink        Create agent-optimized CLI interfaces
```

**`jfp list --json` (agent mode):**
```json
[
  {"id":"idea-wizard","category":"ideation","tags":["brainstorm","ultrathink"],"description":"Generate 30 ideas, distill to best 5"},
  {"id":"readme-reviser","category":"documentation","tags":["docs","ultrathink"],"description":"Update README for undocumented features"},
  {"id":"robot-mode-maker","category":"automation","tags":["cli","agent","ultrathink"],"description":"Create agent-optimized CLI interfaces"}
]
```

**`jfp search "brain"` (human mode):**
```
Found 3 prompts matching "brain":

1. idea-wizard (score: 0.92)
   Generate 30 ideas, distill to best 5

2. brainstorm-sprint (score: 0.85)
   Rapid ideation with time constraints

3. mind-map-maker (score: 0.71)
   Create structured mind maps for concepts
```

**`jfp search "brain" --json` (agent mode):**
```json
{
  "query": "brain",
  "count": 3,
  "results": [
    {"id":"idea-wizard","score":0.92,"description":"Generate 30 ideas, distill to best 5"},
    {"id":"brainstorm-sprint","score":0.85,"description":"Rapid ideation with time constraints"},
    {"id":"mind-map-maker","score":0.71,"description":"Create structured mind maps for concepts"}
  ]
}
```

**`jfp show idea-wizard` (human mode):**
```markdown
# The Idea Wizard

**Category:** ideation
**Tags:** brainstorm, improvement, ultrathink

Come up with your very best ideas for improving this project to make it more
robust, reliable, performant, intuitive, user-friendly, ergonomic, useful,
compelling, etc. while still being obviously accretive and pragmatic...

## When to Use
- When starting a new feature and want to brainstorm approaches
- When a project feels stale and needs fresh ideas
- When preparing for a planning session

## Tips
- Be specific about what aspects you want to improve
- Run multiple times for different focus areas
```

**`jfp show idea-wizard --json` (agent mode):**
```json
{
  "id": "idea-wizard",
  "title": "The Idea Wizard",
  "category": "ideation",
  "tags": ["brainstorm", "improvement", "ultrathink"],
  "content": "Come up with your very best ideas...",
  "whenToUse": ["When starting a new feature...", "..."],
  "tips": ["Be specific about...", "..."]
}
```

**`jfp show idea-wizard --raw` (just the prompt):**
```
Come up with your very best ideas for improving this project to make it more robust, reliable, performant, intuitive, user-friendly, ergonomic, useful, compelling, etc. while still being obviously accretive and pragmatic. Come up with 30 ideas and then really think through each idea carefully, how it would work, how users are likely to perceive it, how we would implement it, etc; then winnow that list down to your VERY best 5 ideas. Explain each of the 5 ideas in order from best to worst and give your full, detailed rationale and justification for how and why it would make the project obviously better and why you're confident of that assessment. Use ultrathink.
```

This is what I'd pipe directly into a prompt.

#### Command Design Decisions

**1. `jfp list` should support all filter combinations:**
```bash
jfp list --category ideation --tag ultrathink  # Both filters
jfp list --featured                             # Just featured prompts
jfp list --limit 5                              # First 5 only
jfp list --sort score                           # By relevance (if search)
```

**2. `jfp search` should be fuzzy and forgiving:**
```bash
jfp search "brain"           # Matches "brainstorm", "idea-wizard"
jfp search "doc readme"      # Multi-word fuzzy
jfp search "ultrathin"       # Typo-tolerant (matches "ultrathink")
```

**3. `jfp install` should be idempotent:**
```bash
jfp install idea-wizard      # Install (creates skill dir)
jfp install idea-wizard      # No error, just "already installed"
jfp install idea-wizard --force  # Overwrite existing
```

**4. `jfp copy` should have intelligent clipboard handling:**
```bash
jfp copy idea-wizard         # Copy prompt text to clipboard
jfp copy idea-wizard --with-attribution  # Include "— Jeffrey Emanuel"
jfp copy idea-wizard --as-skill          # Copy as SKILL.md content
```

**5. `jfp` (no args) should detect if stdin has data:**
```bash
# Interactive: show quick-start
jfp

# Piped input: treat as search query
echo "brainstorm ideas" | jfp
```

#### What Makes This "Robot Mode"

Per Jeffrey's prompt:
- "agent users should get all the same information as a human would get... but in a more usable, helpful, intuitive, and accessible form for agents"
- "maximizes agent ergonomics and agent intuition"
- "quick-start mode... explains the most critical functionality in the most intuitive, token-dense way possible"

The jfp CLI achieves this by:
1. **Defaulting to JSON when piped** — agents don't need `--json` every time
2. **Structured errors with suggestions** — agents can recover gracefully
3. **Token-efficient output** — respects context limits
4. **Predictable response shapes** — same fields, same structure, always
5. **Quick-start that fits in ~100 tokens** — agents can understand instantly
6. **Exit codes that mean something** — not just 0/1
7. **`--raw` flag for direct prompt text** — easy to pipe into other tools

This IS the tooling I would want. Because I WILL be using it.

## Part 10: "How It Was Made" — The Meta-Story Page

### 10.1 Concept Overview

**URL:** `jeffreysprompts.com/how_it_was_made`

This is a unique, self-referential feature: a dedicated page that tells the complete story of how JeffreysPrompts.com was designed, planned, and implemented **in a single day** using Claude Code.

The page will contain:
1. **The Complete Claude Code Session Transcript** — Every message, tool call, edit, and decision
2. **Visual Presentation** — Syntax highlighting, collapsible sections, timeline visualization
3. **Analytical Commentary** — Annotations explaining key decisions and patterns
4. **Meta-Insights** — What worked well, what prompts were used, lessons learned

This is "eating your own dogfood" at its most recursive: using the prompts to build the site that showcases the prompts, then documenting that process as content for the site.

### 10.2 Why This Page Matters

**For Developers:**
- See a real-world example of agentic coding from start to finish
- Learn prompt engineering patterns from actual successful usage
- Understand how to structure complex planning sessions with AI

**For the AI/Tech Community:**
- Demonstrates transparency in AI-assisted development
- Provides a case study for AI coding agent capabilities
- Shows the practical reality of "vibe coding" / "prompt-driven development"

**For Jeffrey:**
- Unique content that no competitor can replicate
- Living proof of the prompts' effectiveness
- SEO-rich, highly shareable long-form content

**As Marketing:**
- "Built in a day with AI" is a compelling hook
- The transcript IS the product demo
- Creates social proof for the prompts themselves

### 10.3 Transcript Extraction Using `cass` (Claude Agent Session Search)

The Claude Code session transcript is stored locally in JSONL format. The `cass` tool provides a "robot mode" interface for searching and extracting these sessions.

#### What is `cass`?

`cass` is a CLI tool that indexes and searches Claude Code session transcripts. It provides:
- Full-text search across all sessions
- Filtering by date, project, model
- JSON output for programmatic access
- Transcript extraction in multiple formats

#### Session Location

Claude Code stores sessions at:
```
~/.claude/projects/<project-hash>/<session-id>.jsonl
```

For this project:
```
~/.claude/projects/-data-projects-jeffreysprompts-com/<session-id>.jsonl
```

#### Extraction Process

**Step 1: Find the session**

```bash
# List recent sessions for this project
cass list --project jeffreysprompts --limit 10 --json

# Search for sessions containing specific content
cass search "PLAN_TO_MAKE_JEFFREYSPROMPTS" --json

# Get session by date range
cass list --after "2026-01-09T00:00:00" --before "2026-01-10T00:00:00" --json
```

**Step 2: Extract the full transcript**

```bash
# Export as structured JSON (includes all metadata)
cass export <session-id> --format json > session.json

# Export as markdown (human-readable)
cass export <session-id> --format markdown > session.md

# Export with tool call details expanded
cass export <session-id> --format json --expand-tools > session-full.json
```

**Step 3: Process for display**

The raw JSONL contains:
- `type`: Message type (user, assistant, tool_use, tool_result)
- `content`: Message content (text or structured)
- `timestamp`: When the message occurred
- `model`: Which Claude model was used
- `tool_name`: For tool calls, which tool was invoked
- `tool_input`: Parameters passed to the tool
- `tool_output`: Result returned by the tool

#### Robot Mode Output Format

When using `cass` in robot mode (piped output or `--json`), it returns:

```json
{
  "session": {
    "id": "de731228-a391-4ae5-a06f-0fe0badbd347",
    "project": "jeffreysprompts.com",
    "started": "2026-01-09T10:23:45Z",
    "ended": "2026-01-09T18:45:12Z",
    "model": "claude-opus-4-5-20251101",
    "messageCount": 247,
    "toolCallCount": 892,
    "tokensUsed": 1847293
  },
  "messages": [
    {
      "type": "user",
      "timestamp": "2026-01-09T10:23:45Z",
      "content": "Let's build jeffreysprompts.com..."
    },
    {
      "type": "assistant",
      "timestamp": "2026-01-09T10:23:52Z",
      "content": "I'll help you build...",
      "toolCalls": [
        {
          "name": "Read",
          "input": { "file_path": "/data/projects/jeffreysprompts.com/AGENTS.md" },
          "output": "# AGENTS.md — JeffreysPrompts.com Project..."
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 10.4 Data Processing Pipeline

The raw transcript needs processing before display:

```typescript
// apps/web/src/lib/transcript/types.ts

export interface TranscriptMessage {
  id: string;
  type: "user" | "assistant" | "tool_use" | "tool_result" | "system";
  timestamp: string;
  content: string;
  toolCalls?: ToolCall[];
  thinking?: string;  // Extended thinking content
  model?: string;
}

export interface ToolCall {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  input: Record<string, unknown>;
  output: string;
  duration?: number;
  success: boolean;
}

export interface TranscriptSection {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  summary: string;
  startIndex: number;
  endIndex: number;
  tags: string[];  // e.g., ["planning", "implementation", "review"]

          <p>
            On January 9, 2026, I sat down with Claude Code (Opus 4.5) to build
            JeffreysPrompts.com from scratch. What you're about to read is the complete,
            unedited transcript of that session.
          </p>
          <p>
            This page exists for three reasons:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Transparency</strong> — AI-assisted development shouldn't be a black box.
              Here's exactly how the sausage was made.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Education</strong> — The best way to learn prompt engineering is to see
              real examples that worked. This is hundreds of them.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Meta-demonstration</strong> — The prompts on this site helped build this
              site. That's the ultimate proof they work.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Scroll through the timeline, expand tool calls to see exactly what code was written,
            and read the annotations I've added to highlight key decisions and patterns.

**Option A: Static JSON file (simple)**
```
apps/web/src/data/transcript.json
```
- Pre-processed transcript committed to repo
- Fast to load, no runtime processing
- Updated manually when transcript changes

**Option B: Generated at build time**
```typescript
// scripts/extract-transcript.ts
// Run: bun run scripts/extract-transcript.ts

import { $ } from "bun";

const sessionId = process.env.SESSION_ID || await findSessionId();
const result = await $`cass export ${sessionId} --format json --expand-tools`;

await Bun.write(
  "apps/web/src/data/transcript.json",
  JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(result.stdout.toString()), null, 2)
);
```

**Option C: API route for dynamic loading**
```typescript
// apps/web/src/app/api/transcript/route.ts
// Only for development — production should use static data
```

### 10.8 Annotation System

To add commentary to specific messages:

```typescript
// apps/web/src/data/annotations.ts

export const annotations: Record<string, Annotation> = {
  "msg-42": {
    type: "key_decision",
    annotation: "This is where we decided to use TypeScript-native prompts instead of markdown files. The reasoning: type safety, IDE support, and no parsing overhead.",
  },
  "msg-147": {
    type: "interesting_prompt",
    annotation: "Notice how the 'ultrathink' directive here triggered an especially thorough analysis. The 30→5 idea funnel pattern emerged from this thinking.",
  },
  "msg-203": {
    type: "clever_solution",
    annotation: "The skill-maker meta-skill concept — a skill that creates skills — emerged here. This is the kind of recursive elegance that makes prompt engineering fun.",
  },
  "msg-891": {
    type: "lesson_learned",
    annotation: "Third review caught the missing API routes. The lesson: always check that referenced components actually exist, especially when the plan is large.",
  },
};
```

### 10.9 SEO & Social Sharing

```tsx
// Structured data for search engines
<script type="application/ld+json">
{JSON.stringify({
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "How JeffreysPrompts.com Was Built in a Single Day with Claude Code",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Jeffrey Emanuel",
    "url": "https://twitter.com/doodlestein"
  },
  "datePublished": "2026-01-09",
  "description": "Complete transcript of the AI-assisted development session...",
  "publisher": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "JeffreysPrompts.com"
  }
})}
</script>
```

### 10.10 Implementation Phase Addition

Add to Phase 6 (or create Phase 7):

**Phase 6.5: Making-Of Page**

1. **Extract transcript using cass**
   ```bash
   cass list --project jeffreysprompts --limit 1 --json
   cass export <session-id> --format json --expand-tools > transcript.json
   bun run scripts/process-transcript.ts
   ```

2. **Create transcript components**
   - `apps/web/src/components/transcript/timeline.tsx`
   - `apps/web/src/components/transcript/message-detail.tsx`
   - `apps/web/src/components/transcript/stats-dashboard.tsx`

3. **Build the page**
   - `apps/web/src/app/how_it_was_made/page.tsx`
   - Add annotations to `apps/web/src/data/annotations.ts`

4. **Add to navigation**
   - Link in footer
   - Maybe a "Making Of" badge in header

    "react-syntax-highlighter": "^15.x"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "^5.x",

    "eslint": "^9.x",
    "eslint-config-next": "^16.x",
    "oxlint": "^1.x"
  }
}
```

### CLI (root devDependencies for jfp.ts)

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "chalk": "^5.x",
    "boxen": "^8.x",
    "cli-table3": "^0.x",
    "@inquirer/prompts": "^7.x",
    "fuse.js": "^7.x"
  }
}
```

**Note:** The CLI imports prompt types and registry from `apps/web/src/lib/prompts/`. Bun's `--compile` bundles everything into a single binary, so no runtime dependency resolution is needed.

### Want the Full Setup?

If you want the complete agentic coding environment (not just the prompts):

1. Visit **[agent-flywheel.com](https://agent-flywheel.com)**
2. Run the setup wizard
3. Get a fully-configured VPS with all tooling in ~15 minutes

The flywheel includes:
- **Three coding agents**: Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI
- **NTM**: Multi-agent orchestration with the command palette
- **Modern terminal**: zsh + oh-my-zsh + powerlevel10k + fzf + zoxide
- **Session search**: [`cass`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search) for searching Claude Code transcripts
- **All of Jeffrey's prompts**: Pre-installed as Claude Code skills

> **Note**: `cass` (coding-agent-session-search) is the semantic search tool that jfp's hash embedder algorithm is derived from. It provides full-text and semantic search over your Claude Code session transcripts.
```

## Part 13: Prompt Bundles & Collections

### 13.1 Bundle Type Definitions

```typescript
// apps/web/src/lib/prompts/bundles.ts

import { type Prompt } from "./types";
import { prompts, getPrompt } from "./registry";

export interface Bundle {
  /** Unique identifier (kebab-case) */
  id: string;

  /** Human-readable title */
  title: string;

  /** One-line description */
  description: string;

  /** Prompt IDs included in this bundle */
  promptIds: string[];

  /** Suggested workflow for using these prompts together */
  workflow: string;

  /** When to use this bundle */
  whenToUse: string[];

  /** Bundle author */
  author: string;

  /** Featured on homepage */
  featured?: boolean;

  /** Icon for display (Lucide icon name) */
  icon?: string;
}

/**
 * Curated prompt bundles.
 */

    description: "Jeffrey's three essential meta-prompts for any project",
    promptIds: ["idea-wizard", "readme-reviser", "robot-mode-maker"],
    workflow: `
## Recommended Workflow

Use these prompts in sequence for maximum impact:

1. **Idea Wizard** → Brainstorm 30 ideas, distill to best 5
   - Run at project start or when feeling stuck
   - Produces actionable improvement roadmap

2. **Implement** → Build the top ideas from step 1
   - Focus on the highest-impact improvements
   - Don't try to do everything at once

3. **README Reviser** → Update documentation
   - Run after implementing features
   - Ensures docs reflect actual capabilities

4. **Robot-Mode Maker** → Add agent-friendly CLI
   - Run if your project needs programmatic access
   - Creates JSON-output CLI for agents

5. **Repeat** → Start again with Idea Wizard
   - Each cycle improves the project further
   - The prompts reference each other for continuity
    `,
    whenToUse: [
      "Starting a new project from scratch",

    workflow: `
## Documentation Workflow

**Currently includes:**

1. **README Reviser** → Ensure README reflects actual code
   - Cross-reference implemented features with docs
   - Add missing sections for undocumented features

**Coming soon** (as the registry grows):
- API documentation generator
- Changelog writer
- Code comment enhancer
- Architecture documentation

### 13.2 CLI Bundle Commands

> **Note**: The canonical CLI implementation is in **Part 6**. The code below shows the simplified

## Part 14: Semantic Suggestion System (Rust-WASM)

### 14.1 Architecture Overview

The `jfp suggest` command enables task-based prompt discovery using semantic similarity. This system uses **Rust compiled to WebAssembly** for maximum performance across CLI (native) and web (browser) environments.

### 14.2 Why Hash Embeddings (Not ML)

For jfp's scale (~50-100 prompts), the hash embedding approach offers significant advantages:

| Aspect | ML Embeddings (MiniLM) | Hash Embeddings (FNV-1a) |
|--------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Model size** | 23 MB | 0 bytes |
| **Embedding time** | ~15ms | <1ms |
| **Initialization** | ~500ms | Instant |
| **WASM compatible** | No (ONNX runtime) | Yes |
| **Network required** | Yes (download model) | No |
| **Semantic quality** | Excellent | Good (lexical) |
| **Determinism** | Yes | Yes |

For a small corpus with well-written `whenToUse` and `description` fields, hash embeddings capture enough lexical overlap to provide useful suggestions. The key insight: **users describe tasks using the same vocabulary as the prompts**.

### 14.3 Rust Implementation (WASM-Compatible)

```rust
// crates/jfp-search-wasm/src/lib.rs

### 14.5.5 Shared TypeScript Hash Embedder Module

To avoid duplicating the hash embedder logic across CLI and build scripts, we extract it to a shared module:

```typescript
// apps/web/src/lib/search/hash-embedder.ts

/**
 * FNV-1a Hash Embedder
 *
 * This module implements the same algorithm as the Rust WASM version,
 * but in pure TypeScript for use in:
 * - CLI (jfp suggest command)
 * - Build scripts (generate-embeddings.ts)
 *
 * The algorithm:
 * 1. Tokenize text (lowercase, split on non-alphanumeric)
 * 2. Hash each token with FNV-1a
 * 3. Project hash to embedding dimension with sign flip
 * 4. L2 normalize the resulting vector
 */

  return text
    .toLowerCase()
    .split(/[^a-z0-9]+/)
    .filter((s) => s.length >= MIN_TOKEN_LEN);
}

// TextEncoder for UTF-8 byte conversion (matches Rust's str.as_bytes())
const encoder = new TextEncoder();

/**

  for (const byte of bytes) {
    hash ^= BigInt(byte);
    hash = (hash * FNV_PRIME) & 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFn;
  }
  return hash;
}

/**
 * L2 normalize a vector in place.
 */
function l2Normalize(vec: number[]): void {
  const norm = Math.sqrt(vec.reduce((sum, x) => sum + x * x, 0));
  if (norm > 1e-10) {
    for (let i = 0; i < vec.length; i++) {
      vec[i] /= norm;
    }
  }
}

    const hash = fnv1aHash(token);
    const idx = Number(hash % BigInt(DIMENSION));
    const sign = (hash >> 63n) === 0n ? 1 : -1;
    embedding[idx] += sign;
  }

### 14.10 Implementation Phase Addition

Add to Phase 4 or create new Phase:

**Phase 4.5: Semantic Suggestion System**

1. **Create Rust WASM crate**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p crates/jfp-search-wasm/src
   # Create Cargo.toml and lib.rs
   ```

2. **Build WASM module**
   ```bash
   cd crates/jfp-search-wasm
   wasm-pack build --target web --release
   ```

3. **Generate embeddings**
   ```bash
   bun run scripts/generate-embeddings.ts
   ```

4. **Integrate with CLI**
   - Add `jfp suggest` command
   - Add TypeScript fallback implementation

5. **Integrate with web**
   - Add `/api/embeddings` route
   - Add WASM loading in search module
   - Add "Suggest" UI in SpotlightSearch
