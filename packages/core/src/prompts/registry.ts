First generate a list of 30 ideas (brief one-liner for each).

Then go through each one systematically and critically evaluate it, rejecting the ones that are not excellent choices for good reasons and keeping the ones that pass your scrutiny.

Then, for each idea that passed your test, explain in detail exactly what the idea is (in the form of a concrete, specific, actionable plan with detailed code snippets where relevant), why it would be a good improvement, what are the possible downsides, and how confident you are that it actually improves the project (0-100%). Make sure to actually implement the top ideas now.

The CLI should be optimized for use by AI coding agents:

1. **JSON Output**: Add --json flag to every command for machine-readable output
2. **Quick Start**: Running with no args shows help in ~100 tokens
3. **Structured Errors**: Error responses include code, message, suggestions
4. **TTY Detection**: Auto-switch to JSON when piped
5. **Exit Codes**: Meaningful codes (0=success, 1=not found, 2=invalid args, etc.)
6. **Token Efficient**: Dense, minimal output that respects context limits

Think about what information an AI agent would need and how to present it most efficiently.

Use ultrathink to design the interface before implementing.`,
